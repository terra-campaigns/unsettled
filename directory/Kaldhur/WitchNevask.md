Protects the River Nevask in [Kaldhur](index.md)
Whether she is a witch or not is unclear.
She is a force of the forest herself, able to go beyond its borders (to some extent).
She travels north and south through the rivers Nevask and Naveh.
But east and west on their own path, subtle and narrow, marked with smooth, flat stones and connecting forest altars.
But now that you know her myth, you also become marked by her - she will come to offer you the forest.

## Myths

The multitude of small copper bells that hang from the witch’s hut are said to have been cast in cities all across the world, each with a unique tone and purpose.
Some have never been heard to make a sound—and perhaps that’s for the best.
