## Treasure smuggling

[Indigo](../Deverain/Indigo.md) learns a route for smuggling treasures:

- Start at the Panner's basecamp.
- Follow the Last River until the Wallcliff Manor
- Cross the wall in the flooded catacombs.
- In the badlands, when the river divides, take the Toren River.
- Take a boat on Hester's Mill.
- Navigate south, through the doomed swamp to the smugglers' shacks, at the coast.
