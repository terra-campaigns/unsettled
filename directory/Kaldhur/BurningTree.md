The tree has no leaves, and its inside burns like golden melted rock.
Inside, there are seven tiny golden bells, tied to the internal walls.
They chime like another bell, inside the barn of the [Rabbit's Inn](../DuskmeadowFringe/RabbitInn.md).
Beside the tree, there are a few round rocks, and a worn hat lies on the ground.
In the vicinity of the tree, one hour into the tree line of the nearby woods, a lost waystation.

According to the [Grandfather of the Farmers](../Wyrmbark/Basajaun.md), the Tree is one of the beacons of the [Witch of Nevask](WitchNevask.md).

## Cartwheel hat

Plain, black, wide-brimmed hat with a low crown—called a cartwheel hat—that was once considered very fashionable by the aristocracy.
Such hats are now deemed “witchy” or to be used by actors in low-life plays.

## Lost Waystation

The lost waystation was home to a statue celebrating the military accomplishments of a once-famous general whose name is lost to time.
The general’s claim to fame was that he cleared large sections of the Kalduhr Forest so the empire could be founded upon the land.
Whatever survived being driven out of the forest returned and destroyed the station, killing everyone who lived and worked there.
Legend has it that if you find the general’s name, you can find the waystation.
If you do, you’ll learn that its tower sits upon a cache of powerful weapons from the general’s armory.
