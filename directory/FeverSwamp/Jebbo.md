Raised among the mist-choked fens, you know the secrets of peat, reeds, and sucking mud. Where others see only treacherous bogs, you see a world of possibilities. Some may even whisper that the marsh runs in your blood.

I'm scrawny with soft skin and frizzy hair. An ambitious boy in filthy clothes. I'm 12 years old.

You consumed a Mischievous Spirit that wreaks havoc on your insides, demanding to be taken home, deep in the Wood. It occupies one slot but absorbs one Fatigue each day. It wants you alive (for now).

**What is your most prized possession?**
Bog-walker suit. A festive suit consisting of a pair of stilts, an animal skin and a mask with antelope horns.

**â–¡ Why did you leave your bog?**
Curse. A Bog Witch cursed you: "Walk soft, for the mire loves you now - your steps sink, never sound". You leave no trace or sound when walking, but your feet always sink slightly when walking on soil. You left the bog to find a solution to this curse
