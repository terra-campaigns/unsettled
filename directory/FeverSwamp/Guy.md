**What was your last big job?**
Moneylender. Someone beat you to the job but left behind a Scroll of Arcane Eye (petty). Arcane Eye: You can see through a magical floating eyeball that flies around at your command. 

**What helps you steal?**
Sweetwhistle - 1 charge. Listeners hear a soft, familiar voice in the distance that they cannot resist following. Recharge: Lose a dear memory. (Describe it.)
