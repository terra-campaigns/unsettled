You are a mere digit on the unerring hand of justice. You go where others fear to tread, unyielding and unbroken.

You are lanky with soft skin and filthy hair. You have a square face and your speech is whispery. You are dressed in foreign clothing. You are humble but also aggressive. You are 31 years old.

**To which order do you belong?**
Order of the Blank Eye. Take a Voidglass Shard. Peer through it to see invisible marks, creatures, and other magical effects. Lose the use of your eye for an hour afterwards (you are deprived).

**What was your vow?**
Valor. The first time you inflict Critical Damage, you receive +d4 HP, returning to the previous limit at the end of combat. If your vow is broken, you die.

**Bond:** Buy your brother’s freedom from Barsul Prison. You carry a Seal-Stained Parchment (petty) listing the official bribe amount and prisoner number. The ink seems to smudge whenever you try to read it.
