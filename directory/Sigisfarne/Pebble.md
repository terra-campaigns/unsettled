Rill Runner: You sing the stories of rivers and lakes, your talents soothing friends and the elements alike. You’ve seen more than most, but somehow it never seems to be enough.

Younger brother of [Stone](Stone.md).

You are statuesque with tattooed skin and filthy hair. You have a square face and your speech is whispery. You are dressed in bloody clothing. You are serene but also vain. You are 44 years old.

**What songs are you best known for?**
The Tinker’s Two-Step. A humorous fairy tale about a gift-giving traveler. Start with a Reed Whistle. Anyone in earshot must pass a WIL save to perform an act of violence.

**What pays your way across the land?**
Wares - You buy low and sell high, always making just enough to get by. Take a single item worth 20gp (or less) from the gear table.

**Bond**: You inherited an old Journal, bound in bark. Each evening, its pages are filled with the events of the day, crassly written from the journal’s perspective. The writing is crude but accurate.
