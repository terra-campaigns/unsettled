> You are a spectre in the night, a fleeting shadow that slips by its prey, unseen. Each kill tests cunning and animal determination, a contest between life and death. You know that one day you will lose. You look forward to it.

- **Appearance**: Brawny Physique, Scarred Skin, and Braided Hair. Your Face is Rakish, your Speech Gravelly. You have Soiled Clothing. You are Disciplined and Craven. You are 50 years old. Broken back and a limp.
- **The Seeker** is consumed by questions of existence, driven to unravel past and present mysteries before time slips away. They delve into forgotten ruins, dissecting enigmas to uncover truths no one dares to seek.
- **Silver Moss**. You once freed a Naiad from a choked stream. In return, it gave you some Silver Moss (petty). 
- **What did you last hunt?** An ice nettle, trapping and draining sheep. You lost your commission when the fungus you introduced killed half the flock. 
- Believer of the [Church of the Weeping Mother](../weepingMother/index.md)

Scarred and broken body.
Someone who has suffered.
