- The local fauna is behaving oddly, displaying heightened aggression, or fleeing the area entirely. Hunters talk of a shadowy figure that roams the Wood, calling to the animals.

You have a Scrawny Physique, Rosy Skin, and Curly Hair. Your Face is Pale, your Speech Stuttering. You have Frayed Clothing. You are Tolerant and Rude. You are 42 years old

You follow the whisperings of the deep earth, the rhythmic pulse of the mycelium forest that grows beneath the surface. The dark holds no terror for you. Also, you really love mushrooms.

A distant cousin left you a small inheritance. Take 20gp, and a strange Compass that always points towards something deep in the Wood.
