Central freestanding ruin looks like an ancient church.
The village has never claimed it and sits mostly abandoned, with its iron gate barred.
A structure older than memory, they say, its stones laid before our ancestors claimed this land as home.

The place has been closed for many generations, despite being in the middle of the village.
Many say it is older than the village, which is already ancient.

Broken stone floor, an altar with symbols of our religion, the [Church of the Weeping Mother](../weepingMother/index.md).
Decrepit furniture with runic scratching, and a scaffolding in one of the sides of the building.

Bell tower, the bell lays on the floor, where raptors make a nest. The staircases up are very worn.

## Tombs

Downstairs there are 4 tunnels: bread, crown, teardrop and halo.
Smell of decay and moisture.

Tunnel of the **Crown**: five stone coffins, four violated, with sculptures of kings in weird ornaments.
One of them holds a regalia that looks from the Church of the Weeping Mother.  

Tunnel of the **Halo**: freestanding coffins, open.
Figures look religious, from the Church of the Weeping Mother.

Tunnel of the **Teardrop**: Small room, some artistic paintings.
Symbology of the Church, but not the stories.
One of them is of a pregnant woman on pilgrimage.
Some areas are covered in soot.
A small secret passage behind the altar.
