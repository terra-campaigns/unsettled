The year 1025 has had a bad harvest for Sigisfare, as the [village let go of one-third](../../campaigns/Book_01/ep_004.md) of its farms around the spring. Ayrrin's half-sister died of malnutrition in June, the daughter of a proto-apothecary.

> You promised a childhood friend that youâ€™d bring them back a rare gift, something unique in all the world. Take a Bracelet (petty) woven from twine and wildflowers.

You strike from afar, but that does not make you a coward. You are a musician, the song of your bowstring nought but a warning, singing the silent promise of a quick death.

You have a Scrawny Physique, Weathered Skin, and Braided Hair. Your face is sunken, and your speech is formal. You have Filthy Clothing. You are Honourable and Nervous. You are 39 years old.

Your Past
How did you earn your bow? Training. If you are the first to attack, melee attacks against you are impaired until you take STR damage.

What kind of wood is your bow made from? White Ash (d6, bulky). Can be used in place of a shield in melee combat (+1 Armour). 

## Carries the Scaled Mace (d8)

- Wooden, looks ceremonial, aptly made
- Wielder becomes braver and sharper-minded when attacking reptiles (d12 damage)
- Reptiles become more aggressive towards the wielder
