You strike from afar, but that does not make you a coward. You are a musician, the song of your bowstring nought but a warning, singing the silent promise of a quick death.

You have an Athletic Physique, Tanned Skin, and Curly Hair. Your Face is Perfect, your Speech Cryptic. You have Livery Clothing. You are Gregarious (sociable) and Rude. You are 43 years old.

**Bond:** An entertainer once visited your home, filling it with story and song. He left one day without a word, leaving behind only a Miniature Lute. Something rattles inside.

Mother of Clive, who was found dead in the ruined church in Sigisfarne.

Flowers: Flowers appear in your hair and cannot be removed—if you cut them out, you bleed and they regrow.
