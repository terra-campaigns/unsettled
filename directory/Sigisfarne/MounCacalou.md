You have a Lanky Physique, Webbed Skin, and Oily Hair. Your Face is Pale, your Speech Precise. You have Frayed Clothing. You are Disciplined and Aggressive.

### Description

You walk the line between healer and harrower, knowing the frailty of the flesh but also the secrets that lie within. With the right tools, life and death are merely words.

### Bonds

You once freed a Naiad from a choked stream. In return, it gave you some Silver Moss (petty). Swallow it near water and the creature will come, once, to repay its debt.

### Omens

It feels like winter has arrived too quickly this year, frost and snows making their appearance much earlier than expected. There is talk of a pattern to the frost found in windows, ponds, and cracks in the ground. It almost looks like a map.
