Beast Handler: You alone can walk among the creatures of the wild, fearless and in control. You share a connection with animals that others can only dream of… so long as you don’t become their snack.

You are statuesque with oily skin and luxurious hair. You have a broken face and your speech is gravelly. You are dressed in antique clothing. You are ambitious but also craven. You are 44 years old.

What creature is your specialty?
Felines - Take a sack of Whiskerwort. Its odor can calm and control even the largest of cats.

What have you learned from the creatures of the wild?
That there is far more to the world than meets the eye. With quiet concentration, you can borrow the senses of a nearby creature of your specialty.

Bond: During your travels, you met a dying hunter who asked you to deliver a message to their loved ones. Take a Letter (petty), sealed with tree sap. It is addressed only to the Lord Of Winter.
