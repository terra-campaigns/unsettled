Born of both the mortal world and the unseen, you are an enigma to some and feared by many. Yours is the tale of what happens when two worlds collide. Forages for medicinal herbs and makes potions.

You have an Athletic Physique, Rosy Skin, and Curly Hair. Your Face is Elongated. You have Soiled Clothing. You are Humble and Craven. You are 44 years old.

**Bond:** You inherited a Single Gem (500gp, cold and brittle) from a long-dead relative. It arrived with a warning: squander your newfound riches, and a debt long thought forgotten would be called.

Not of courage. Scared of the unknown.

Under a vendetta of the [PiotChant](../DuskmeadowFringe/PiotChant.md), the Forest Queen lifted at the [Queensweald](../DuskmeadowFringe/Queensweald.md).

Received a cravat from a faerie. It is brown, the most beautiful brown. It catches attention. 
Wearing it makes parlaying with the Fae easier. They will look at you with different eyes.

[Drake](Drake.md) is as beautiful as Fae: his features become your ideal of beauty.
