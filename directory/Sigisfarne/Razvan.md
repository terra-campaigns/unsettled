Born of both the mortal world and the unseen, you are an enigma to some and feared by many. Yours is the tale of what happens when two worlds collide. Forages for medicinal herbs and makes potions.

You have an athletic physique, Rosy Skin, and curly hair. Your Face is Elongated. You wear Soiled Clothing. You are Humble and Craven. You are 44 years old.

**Bond:** You inherited a Single Gem (500gp, cold and brittle) from a long-dead relative. It arrived with a warning: squander your newfound riches, and a debt long thought forgotten would be called.

Not of courage. Scared of the unknown.

Under a vendetta of the [PiotChant](../DuskmeadowFringe/PiotChant.md), the Forest Queen lifted at the [Queensweald](../DuskmeadowFringe/Queensweald.md).

Received a cravat from a faerie. It is brown, the most beautiful brown. It catches attention. 
Wearing it makes parlaying with the Fae easier. They will look at you with different eyes.

[Drake](Drake.md) is as beautiful as Fae: his features become your ideal of beauty.

Named Champion of the [Mountain Court](../DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md) by [Jock](../DuskmeadowFringe/Jock.md).

Has a doppelganger living as her.

## Life and Death Ceremony 

A small pixie comes in everyone's dream and handles a parchment written in gold text. You wake up holding said parchment.

It is an invitation to celebrate the life and death of Razzy the Bunny. A woman of the forest, a woman of humankind.

Her ceremony will take place in Queensweald and will last 77 hours. There will be 7 banquets and 11 orgies. Goblins will be sacrificed in her name, and their blood will be drunk by human children, so many more Razzys are born again.

In the last event, Razzy's body will be placed in a hole on earth, and through her a cherry tree will grow in the years to come. The cherry tree will be called Razzy. Their fruits will have the shape of bunny tails.
