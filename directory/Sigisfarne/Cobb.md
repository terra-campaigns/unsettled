- _Plagued by Nightmares_: It comes for you every night, without fail. You do not know if

they are from the beginning, or the end. All you know is that they won’t stop, and that they must mean something. After a week of nightmares, tell your Facilitator two distinct images that linger at the edge of your remembering.

![](../../imgs/gallery/Pasted%20image%2020251016152628.png)

Human (late 30s), Short black beard, maroon brigandine. _Military affairs, sword fighting, calligraphy._ Desires to unite the human race and let it prosper in the lands of unsettled. Fears that the fey are inherrently evil and thus cannot be trusted.

Cobb, the field warden, has been around the area of Sigisfarn for some time now.
Protecting the peasantry, scaring thieves, just your general fieldwardenry.
But a large fire has burned down large parts of his family farm.
With rumours about the unholy mole pest in the west. He decided it would be time to field an expedition to rid the world of this vermin.

Named Champion of the [Mountain Court](../DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md) by [Jock](../DuskmeadowFringe/Jock.md).

After [the 13th November](../../campaigns/Book_01/ep_043.md), Cobb wakes up in cold sweats each night, sensing the presence of chaos and fey around him. He sees two images. 

The first image of an [elven woman, that at first seems like a figure of utmost beauty](../DuskmeadowFringe/TheHunger.md). Pale silver skin, slender figure, long golden hair a long blue revealing robe. But her face is gravely distorted and melevolent. Rows of jarring teeth, her eyes covered by an unholy hood. Her hands sporting razor sharp nails.

The second image of a [cathedral like building](../FoldedBelow/UndergroundTemple.md), men, women and children are entering in their most finest of clothes. But alas, it is burning, the flames mock Cobb and he is grappled by a set of chains. He feels the chains heat up as more and more people enter the building. He can see Jebbo, TJ, Baron, and others entering the flaming cathedral as it collapsed on them all.
