> The name is Cobb, but friends call me Cobert. 

Cobb, the field warden, has been around the area of Sigisfarn for some time now.
Protecting the peasantry, scaring thieves, just your general fieldwardenry.
But a large fire has burned down large parts of his family farm.
With rumours about the unholy mole pest in the west. He decided it would be time to field an expedition to rid the world of this vermin.

Named Champion of the [Mountain Court](../DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md) by [Jock](../DuskmeadowFringe/Jock.md).
