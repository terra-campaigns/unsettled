You sing the stories of rivers and lakes, your talents soothing friends and the elements alike. You've seen more than most, but somehow it never seems to be enough.

You have a Statuesque Physique, Scarred Skin, and Wavy Hair. Your Face is Sunken, your Speech Booming. You have Rancid Clothing. You are Ambitious and Rude. You are 50 years old.

**Bond:** One of your ancestors wronged a Moss Witch, who cursed their bloodline. Your visage causes mirrors to shatter. You’ve noticed that the shards can sometimes reveal illusions.

Not content to sit still. Driven man.
