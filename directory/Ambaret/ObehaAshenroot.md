You were a **Defrocked Priest of [the Sisters](../weepingMother/theSisters.md)** —, but omens turned inward. You joined the Gauntlet and became a **Bodyguard**. You guard a corpse long convinced it is still your master.

You are short with tattooed skin and curly hair. You have a rakish face and a blunt manner of speech. You are dressed in foreign clothing. You are gregarious but also rude. You are **35** years old.

**Bond**: Destroy the work of **Ajino the Debauched Painter**. You found a Palette Knife (petty) in the trash behind his studio. It oozes a slow rainbow oil and whispers blasphemies when you're asleep.
