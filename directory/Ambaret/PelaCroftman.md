Treasure Hunter from the Gauntlet Guild: You were an **Errant Knight** — but duelling drew no honour. You joined the Gauntlet and became a Bodyguard. You guard a **stuffed cat**, long convinced it is still your master.

You are flabby with tattooed skin and luxurious hair. You have a square face, and your speech is whispery. You are dressed in frumpy clothing. You are disciplined but also vain. You are 49 years old.

**What treasure have you found that still has a single use?**
A whistle carved from bone; blow it and drive the spirit from a living body.

**What are your mundane defences?**
Sturdy helmet and Masterwork longsword
