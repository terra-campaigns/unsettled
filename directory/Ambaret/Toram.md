A former **Inquisitor of [the Sisters](../weepingMother/theSisters.md)**, considered heretical for too close relations with his sister [Obeha Ashenroot](ObehaAshenroot.md). Joined the Gauntlet and became a **Lockpick**.

Short with curly hair, a rakish face, and a blunt manner of speech.
Dressed in foreign clothing.
**40** years old.

Has a stiff shoulder with a terrible scar on it.
The pinky on the left hand was bitten off.

After surviving an incursion beyond the Desert of Bones in the south, he came too close to death in the Crystal Frontier.
Decided to see his sister again, and travelled to the [KAW's excavation](../TombOfHorrors/index.md).
When he arrived, his sister was dead.
And more weirdly, she was now a man.

Likes to pay his own fees.

**Bond**: Like his sister, destroy the work of **Ajino the Debauched Painter**. Took his sister's Palette Knife (petty).
