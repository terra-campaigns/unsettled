A great city built against the wall. At least... It used to be a great city. Now it is just mostly ruins. We have taken refuge in the upper circle of the wall, in the main keep.

1. Guild Hall - Chapter Master Tarmac residency
2. Store House - Gear, torches, etc.
3. Tavern "The Blue Hare"
4. Smiths (Armourer and weapons)
5. Apothecary (herbs, medicine)
6. Makeshift Temple
