- 2 days north of Sigisfarne.
- Located within a dead forest.
- Dried meat, [some think](../../campaigns/Book_01/ep_005.md) of human origin.
- It was well-maintained, but found in disrepair during an [incursion north](../../campaigns/Book_01/ep_025.md).
- Fixed by [Artea](../Wyrmbark/Artea.md) before [an incursion to the quarry](../../campaigns/Book_01/ep_032.md).
