Their family has been cursed for generations in the warm south where they come from.
Until last winter, they lived in the [Mountain Court](MountainCourt.md), but because her boys were very aggressive during the full moon, the court decided to kill them.
They fled to this ruined property. But there is a bounty on their heads, so they continue to be hunted down.
