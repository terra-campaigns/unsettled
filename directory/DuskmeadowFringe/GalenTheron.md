Rural villagers, vassals to the [Mountain Court](MountainCourt.md).
Their obligations to the court have become heavier, and the village elders decided to send them both to a known bandit lair.
Those bandits have stolen from travellers and other villagers, and now they are disposing of their goods anyway.
