They want to recover the badlands, at any cost.

This figure, depicted in village murals with
a fat-bellied cauldron, is the patron deity of
abundance and the symbol of the bountiful
earth. Gaining Filakhâ€™s blessing is not easy;
before the deity will bless a plot of land, it
must be purged of competing supernatural
forces. Thus, the faithful are particularly
interested in rooting out ancient ruins and
other spiritually dangerous sites, which they
believe prevent communion with Filakh.
