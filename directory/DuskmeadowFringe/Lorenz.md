> One of your ancestors wronged a Moss Witch, who cursed their bloodline. Your visage causes mirrors to shatter. You’ve noticed that the shards can sometimes reveal illusions.

You are known by the smell of molten metal and the jingle of tin. You are no mere merchant but an artisan of fire and metal.

You are statuesque with tattooed skin and no hair. You have a elongated face and your speech is gravelly. You are dressed in elegant clothing. You are humble but also deceitful. You are 34 years old.

What is your trade?
You were a military smelter, before peace destroyed your livelihood. Take a smelting hammer (d10, bulky) and a tin helm (+1 Armor). Given time and adequate materials, you can repair armor.

What never fails to get you out of trouble?
Black Tar - Versatile: both sticky and highly flammable. 3 uses.
