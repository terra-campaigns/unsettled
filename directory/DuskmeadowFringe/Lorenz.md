> One of your ancestors wronged a Moss Witch, who cursed their bloodline. Your visage causes mirrors to shatter. You’ve noticed that the shards can sometimes reveal illusions.

You are known by the smell of molten metal and the jingle of tin. You are no mere merchant but an artisan of fire and metal.

You are statuesque with tattooed skin and no hair. You have a elongated face and your speech is gravelly. You are dressed in elegant clothing. You are humble but also deceitful. You are 34 years old.

What is your trade?
You were a military smelter, before peace destroyed your livelihood. Take a smelting hammer (d10, bulky) and a tin helm (+1 Armor). Given time and adequate materials, you can repair armor.

What never fails to get you out of trouble?
Black Tar - Versatile: both sticky and highly flammable. 3 uses.

Named Champion of the [Mountain Court](../DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md) by [Jock](../DuskmeadowFringe/Jock.md).

## Abandons adventuring and retires

> [Garriout](../Deverain/Gary.md) was at the Monastery of the [ElderWay](../Wyrmbark/ElderWay.md) in hopes of finding a cure for baldness with the hairy druids. He was just about to scalp one of the druids for further research when he spotted his nephew, Lorenz, walking in. 
> 
> Lorenz wanted to do penance for his deeds and live a quiet life for a while to lessen the nightmares, maybe. When he saw his uncle, he told him about his struggles. He wanted his uncle to take the amulet with a person inside to find a way to save him. Lorenz was afraid that if he tried it himself, it would just end worse. 
> 
> His uncle could also study the pearl sword, as Lorenz never figured out how to recharge it and did not trust himself anymore with deadly weapons.
