You delve deep into the Wood, prying its secrets from between rough boughs and whispering leaves. To this verdant kingdom, you are no mere scholar but its confidant as well.

You are towering with webbed skin and wavy hair. You have a pale face and your speech is precise. You are dressed in rancid clothing. You are courageous but also greedy. You are 32 years old.

How has the Wood failed you?
You were poisoned, losing your sense of taste and smell. You can now withstand noxious fumes and always carry Antitoxin (2 uses).

What keeps you safe while in the Wood?
Delphinium - Breathe water for up to one hour. 1 use, but can be divided into fractional doses.

Bond: You crossed a creature of the Wood, and it cursed you with a Stone Heart. With each passing month, the stone grows heavier by one slot. Until your debt is lifted, you cannot truly die.

Retired in [Hendenburgh](../Kryptwood/Hendenburgh.md) in June 1025, with an eye on the innkeeper.
