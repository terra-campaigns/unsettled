Nocturnal 1-2â€™ tall imps, looking like scrawny humans
except for a long snout and two mole-like incisors. They
use insect claws and shells to make weapons and armour.
Piot chants live in gallery networks they dig under
pastoral lands, linking their communities together. They
prey on crops that encroach on the forest, but try to not
confront mortals directly, except when a vendetta is
declared.

The remains (and inventory) of Mortus, [Theron](../Wyrmbark/Theron.md) and [Flax](Flax.md) are left in the galleries west of [Sigisfarne](../Sigisfarne/index.md).

## Cobb's raid plan

**Molefolk tunnels**

There are three entrances to the tunnel system. The main one (north west) leads directly to a sleeping chamber. During the last raid, the molefolk in that room was slaughtered. These could be reoccupied or further fortified.
The south and north ones seem to be less guarded. The tunnels itself are narrow, giving almost no space for rotating characters in the small parts. 

*What are the dangers of the Molefolk tunnel?*
There are three main dangers:
* The shaman - Is able to play a magical flute and use spells. The magical flute causes the insects that are crawling everywhere to swarm the intruders. This is the main threat. Secondly, he can mind control using spells. So the shaman should be dispatched as soon as possible. His flute should be taken as soon as possible.
* The folk - although these critters are weak, they are numerous. We expect around 10-20 of these vermin to still crawl around in the tunnels. 
* The roots - The roots itself seem to suck your very soul. The roots are really vulnerable for fire, so we should stock up on torches
