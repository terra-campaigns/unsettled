Nocturnal 1-2â€™ tall imps, looking like scrawny humans
except for a long snout and two mole-like incisors. They
use insect claws and shells to make weapons and armour.
Piot chants live in gallery networks they dig under
pastoral lands, linking their communities together. They
prey on crops that encroach on the forest, but try to not
confront mortals directly, except when a vendetta is
declared.

The remains (and inventory) of Mortus, [Theron](../Wyrmbark/Theron.md) and [Flax](Flax.md) are left in the galleries west of [Sigisfarne](../Sigisfarne/index.md).
