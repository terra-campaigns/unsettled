hooks:
- Adventurers from Sigisfarne have found this Sky Spire northwest of Sigisfarne. No one came near it, but on a summer night, it lit up.
- A vengeful Nymph was upset in the woods, a watch east of the Mountain Court. The river can be crossed in drier seasons. Varg and Gunther are on the list of this Nymph.
