You walk the line between healer and harrower, knowing the frailty of the flesh but also the secrets that lie within. With the right tools, life and death are merely words.

You are towering with weathered skin and curly hair. You have a perfect face and your speech is droning. You are dressed in elegant clothing. You are disciplined but also deceitful. You are 34 years old.

How have you “improved” yourself?
Both ears have been surgically enhanced, tripling your hearing. You can focus on a specific sound, such as a conversation, at a great distance. You wear an ear flap to protect against sudden loud noises (WIL save to avoid temporary paralysis).

What rare tool is essential to your work?
Regrowth Salve - Regrows a body part over the course of a day. 1 use.

Bond: You crossed a creature of the Wood, and it cursed you with a Stone Heart. With each passing month, the stone grows heavier by one slot. Until your debt is lifted, you cannot truly die.

In the end of June, their heart becomes heavier.
