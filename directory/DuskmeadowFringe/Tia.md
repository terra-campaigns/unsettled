Rill Runner: You sing the stories of rivers and lakes, your talents soothing friends and the elements alike. You’ve seen more than most, but somehow it never seems to be enough.

You are towering with marked skin and long hair. You have a rakish face and your speech is droning. You are dressed in frayed clothing. You are ambitious but also greedy. You are 46 years old.

**What songs are you best known for?**
The Sylph and Her Lover. A bawdy tale of lost love. Start with a Breeze Knot (3 2 charges). Creates a strong breeze. Recharge: Tie it to a mast during a storm.

**What pays your way across the land?**
Wares - You buy low and sell high, always making just enough to get by. Take a single item worth 20gp (or less) from the gear table. (sword)
