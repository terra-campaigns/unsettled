If you ask any experienced treasure-hunter to name the most terrifying thing in the forest,
one location always comes up more often than not. It goes by many names:
*The Fall, The Well, The Quarry.* Despite its many names, it’s always described the same way.

> The ground ahead of me slightly declined, the descent eventually opening up to a massive hole as wide across as ten-score men lying foot to head. I got closer to see what might be down there. Every step forward filled me with vertigo so that I might fall at any minute. I couldn’t see the bottom. But I heard it—a thousand hammers tapping against a thousand chisels—plink, plink, plink.

Here, the stories diverge. Some say miners are looking for gold, silver, or precious
gems. Others say it’s sculptors, crafting idols and rare artefacts for their gods. Whatever is
down there hasn’t seen the light of day for hundreds or thousands of years—anything brought back
would surely be a unique trophy capable of fetching a sizable sum.

- 2 days north of Sigisfarne.
- Veins of thin red powdered ore.
- Enslaved stone statues of children.
- Rubies found.
- Are the rubies hearts of the mountain?
- Is the mountain a reflection of the [weeping mother](../weepingMother/index.md)?
