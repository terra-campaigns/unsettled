- You found a Tiny Crystal Prism (petty) buried in the dirt. When held up to the light, it shows visions of an unknown location deep within the Wood. Sometimes, you feel a presence looking back at you.

Protectors of the harvest, defense against pests, thieves, and beasts. A position of great honor, while it lasts: many guardians do not live out their natural lives.

You are athletic with webbed skin and frizzy hair. You have a broken face and your speech is whispery. You are dressed in foreign clothing. You are disciplined but also bitter. You are 47 years old.

**What got the better of you?**
Wolves, or so you thought. You are now a Werewolf (8 HP, 15 STR, 14 DEX, claws (d6+d6), bite (d8)). Your WIL remains the same. You can turn at will (once per day) but must make a WIL save to revert. Anyone left alive from your attacks must make a WIL save to avoid infection.

**What tool saved your life?**
Clatter Keeper - A hand-cranked device that emits a loud noise, frightening away most creatures.
