You copy ancient texts and illuminate manuscripts, recording the voices of the clever, the great, and the powerful. You will prove that the pen truly is mightier than the sword.

You are statuesque with webbed skin and no hair. You have a perfect face, and your speech is stuttering. You are dressed in soiled clothing. You are cautious but also nervous. You are 59 years old.

**What work did you keep for yourself?**
A Treatise on the Abyss - A nondescript black book. An in-depth, largely theoretical text describing the Roots and information about the location of a nearby Gate.

**How do you transcribe sensitive information?**
Sanguine Lens - Extracts blood from a target without their knowledge. A stolen drop placed on the eye reveals memories from the past day.
