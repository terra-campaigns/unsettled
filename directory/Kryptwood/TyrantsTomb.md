An enormous dead oak tree has partially consumed ancient brickwork. Ravens nest in its brittle grey branches. Between the sprawling roots, a huge rock has been shattered into pieces. Behind it, worn stone steps descend into darkness.

The area around Hendenburgh was ruled by the Kryptwood Tyrant centuries ago. This vile and bloodthirsty ruler hunted his peasants for sport with the help of a pack of bloodthirsty giant hounds raised on human flesh. This is his tomb.
