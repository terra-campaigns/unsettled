An ancient witch coven, consisting of Mother Blackcap, Wailing Winnifred, and the Matriarch, makes their home within the Krpytwood. The hags are treated with fear and veneration by the villagers of Hendenburgh. The coven provides simple spells, cures and potions for those who risk their bargains. The crones are ancient and powerful.

Smoke rises from a cosy cottage surrounded by herb gardens and rose bushes.
This dwelling is the home of the crones.
Some say that by day, the crones appear as beautiful young women, naked apart from grass crowns.
By night, they manifest in their proper and hideous forms.
