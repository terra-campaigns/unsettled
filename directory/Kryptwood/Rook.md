hooks: You found a Tiny Crystal Prism (petty) buried in the dirt. Holding up to the light shows visions of an unknown location deep within the Wood. Sometimes you feel a presence looking back at you. You don't recognise the location or know how to get there. But in your vision, you see an unbelievably tall wall, and the sun setting on its far right. You are surrounded by woods that almost glitter with the last sun rays.

You are a shepherd to the departed. You listen to the final whispers of the dead as they descend into the cold, unyielding earth. You know that to celebrate the gift of life fully, we must honor its finale as well.

You are towering with weathered skin and braided hair. You have a elongated face and your speech is precise. You are dressed in frayed clothing. You are cautious but also bitter. You are 34 years old.

What did you take from the dead?
**A mortal wound from a freed revenant**. You were healed, but the disfigurement has made you a pariah. You require neither air nor sustenance but are still subject to pain and death. Trapped between worlds, the dead see you as one of their own.

What tool was invaluable in your work?
Manacles - Though old, it’s still effective even against the very strong. You don’t have the key.

Since Jun 1025, he has lived in [Aelfwin's Estate](AelfwinEstate.md), doing work burying the dead in the region.
