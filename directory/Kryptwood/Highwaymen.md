A gang of notorious highway robbers led by **Sly George** (a vainglorious coward whose reputation has been grossly exaggerated through folk songs of his own composition). The highwaymen use the Kryptwood as a hideout between robberies.

[The Crones](TheCrones.md) poison Sly George in Jul-Wheat 1025.
