You alone can walk among the creatures of the wild, fearless and in control. You share a connection with animals that others can only dream of... so long as you don't become their snack.

You have a Short Physique, Scarred Skin, and Long Hair. Your Face is Bony, your Speech Gravelly. You have Antique Clothing. You are Courageous and Vengeful. Your age: 20.

**Silver Moss**: You once freed a Naiad from a choked stream. In return, it gave you some Silver Moss (petty). Swallow it near water and the creature will come, once, to repay its debt.

There is a village known far and wide for its impressive 'mother tree', said to shelter the town’s secrets in its boughs. Recently, it has begun bleeding red sap, worrying the elders.

**What creature is your specialty?**
**Rodents**: Take a Pan Flute that emits a high-pitched sound that only rodents can hear. So long as you play, they will follow, even to their deaths.

**What have you learned from the creatures of the wild?**
That the pulse of the hunt is a powerful impulse. You have a sense for when predators, even those not of your specialty are near. 

Will be paid 1000gp if they solve the [issue](../../campaigns/CoastWolves/004.md) with the [moleman](../DuskmeadowFringe/PiotChant.md) in Sigisfarne.
