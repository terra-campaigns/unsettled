A bitter ex-priest who has turned to alcohol.
Pastor of the [Weeping Mother](../weepingMother/index.md).
Turning his beliefs to the heretical sect of the [Sisters](../weepingMother/theSisters.md), which spreads in the realm.

Was a monk at the [Middle Waters Minster](../DuskmeadowFringe/MiddleWatersMinster.md).
Friends with [Lazlo](../DuskmeadowFringe/Lazlo.md) when both lived in the Minster.
Friendship revived when Lazlo spent two summer months in [Hendenburgh](Hendenburgh.md) in 1025.

Lazlo's conversation with the pastor:

> I reassure him that whatever called the hounds, it wasn't his lack of faith. If anything, it was likely the villagers fears and worries that called them, and simple as they are, they saw a scapegoat in him. I gently remind him that such tests of faith are frequently described in many religious texts, including the mother's, which I expect he remembers. And that many such tests are hard if not seemingly impossible for the common man to withstand. (Indicating I don't blame him for finding a coping mechanism.)
