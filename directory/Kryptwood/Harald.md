**Description:**
You walk the line between healer and harrower, knowing the frailty of the flesh but also the secrets that lie within. With the right tools, life and death are merely words.

You are athletic with oily skin and curly hair. You have a perfect face and your speech is stuttering. You are dressed in frumpy clothing. You are tolerant but also aggressive. You are 43 years old.

**Bonds:**
You consumed a Mischievous Spirit that wreaks havoc on your insides, demanding to be taken home, deep in the Wood. It occupies one slot but absorbs one Fatigue each day. It wants you alive (for now).

**Your Past:**
One arm is fully metal and comes off at the shoulder. It can be used as a weapon (d8, bulky when not attached) and can move independently if you are within sight of it.

Regrowth Salve - Regrows a body part over the course of a day. 1 use.

**Harold's origin**: He might have been on the run from Hendenburgh (or a nearby village) after a botched job.

Multiple bitemarks on his face, after a serious attack of the Hounds of [Hendenburgh](Hendenburgh.md).
Retired in his uncle's state after it.
