Close to [Hendenburgh](Hendenburgh.md).
The Tyrant and his hounds killed the Lord family.
Currently, the property of the Duke of [Deverain](../Deverain/index.md).

[Beatrix](../Deverain/Beatrix.md) does not know how to read, but she has a keen sense for official documents.
And also a sixth sense for finding them.
The original occupants of this villa left their documents in one of the offices, inside a book.
And Beatrix found them.

She also found a document signed by the Lord of this villa, in accord with the Duque of [Deverain](../Deverain/index.md), in which he left the property to his daughter.

They are a family of lower nobility (when compared to the bigger and luxurious houses).
There were four people in the main house (based on the number of bedrooms and closets).
Three were adults, and one was a child.
For each adult, a strange mask is hidden deep in the clothes drawers.

Their names:
- Fietje, Victor and Achim are the adults.
- Helge is the daughter.
- Their surname is van der Wouden.

## Pavasarii

[Daegal](../Sigisfarne/Daegal.md) is setting up a Pavasarii Hall in the villa.
The Pavasarii Hall already has an antagonistic faction: [Jock](../DuskmeadowFringe/Jock.md), his men, and the [Mountain Court](../DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md).
