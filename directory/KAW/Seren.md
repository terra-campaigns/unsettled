You are known by the smell of molten metal and the jingle of tin. You are no mere merchant but an artisan of fire and metal.

You are stout with soft skin and wispy hair. You have a sharp face . You are dressed in filthy clothing. You are merciful but also bitter. You are 22 years old.

**What is your trade?**
You build small contraptions for local guilds (and don’t ask too many questions). Take an extra 40gp and a wanted poster with your face on it. Given time and materials, you can open almost any door or vault.

**What never fails to get you out of trouble?**
Carrion Cat - A clever pet, small enough to hide in your pack (bulky), but strong enough to scare off smaller predators. Requires one Ration a day, and it must be meat.

**Bond**: Free the kindly followers of the Piper. You possess a Flute of Black Ash (petty), strung with colourful ribbons. It cannot play music—only silence.
