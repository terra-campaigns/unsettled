You were a Unmasked Faeborn — but illusions clung to the skin. You joined the Gauntlet and became a Leech. You draw blood that crawls back toward the body.

You are rugged with marked skin and frizzy hair. You have a broken face and your speech is whispery. You are dressed in elegant clothing. You are Calm, patient, but also Slow. You are 76 years old.

Bond: Earn the right to your family’s name. You inherited a Fragmented Signet (petty). It lacks the central gem. Stories say the gem lies buried beneath your ancestor’s shame.
