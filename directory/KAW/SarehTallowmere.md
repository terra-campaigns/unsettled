You were an **Enlightened Miner** — but paths collapsed. You joined the Gauntlet and became a **Sellsword**. You kill the same man in every town.

You are stout with rosy skin and braided hair. You have a bony face and precise speech. You are dressed in frayed clothing. You are gregareous but also vain. You are 49 years old.

**Bond**: Establish an estate in the Levasti countryside. You were gifted a Deed Scroll (petty) sealed with gold wax. The coordinates lead to a field of thorns and stones. Still, the name at the bottom is yours.
