You are a mere digit on the unerring hand of justice. You go where others fear to tread, unyielding and unbroken.

You are towering with marked skin and luxurious hair. You have a rakish face and your speech is precise. You are dressed in foreign clothing. You are serene but also bitter. You are 26 years old.

**To which order do you belong?**
Order of Canaas - Once per day, you can change into a wolf. Take a Quicksilver Chain. Without it, you are unable to shift back.

**What was your vow?**
Valor. The first time you inflict Critical Damage, you receive +d4 HP, returning to the previous limit at the end of combat. If your vow is broken, you die.

**Bond**: You promised a childhood friend that you’d bring them back a rare gift, something unique in all the world. Take a Bracelet (petty) woven from twine and wildflowers.
