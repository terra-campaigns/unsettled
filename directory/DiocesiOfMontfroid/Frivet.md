One of the younger villages in Montfroid, Frivet, was built to guard the trade road between Malvezi and Castelnou.
With the Hammersea often impassible from Black Pact pirates and sea monsters, most internal commerce within Montfroid runs along this road, which stretches from Nouvila in the north to Malvezi in the south.
With its central location, an unusual number of craftsmen and merchants have found a place within its palisade.
