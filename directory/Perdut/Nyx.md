> You found a Tiny Crystal Prism (petty) buried in the dirt. When held up to the light, it shows visions of an unknown location deep within the Wood. Sometimes, you feel a presence looking back at you.

You have a Stout Physique, Tanned Skin, and Filthy Hair. Your Face is Square, your Speech Squeaky. You have Elegant Clothing. You are Merciful and Greedy. You are 32 years old.

Born of both the mortal world and the unseen, you are an enigma to some and feared by many. Yours is the tale of what happens when two worlds collide.
Not fully present in the world.

**What did you bring back from the Unseelie Court?**
A Black Rose Fiddle (bulky). Its music causes intense sadness and immobility in nearby mortals. (Others are merely fascinated.) You don't know how to play.

**What concoction do you carry, and what rare ingredients did you gather to make it?**
Rebirth Ash: Remnants of a bark spirit. Sprinkle to reignite a fire that has died or return to life a creature that has died only moments before. 3 uses.

***Scars***

- Broken rib

Has a vendetta of the [Piot Chant](../DuskmeadowFringe/PiotChant.md) on her face.

Carries a carving knife with her. And a small carved crow.
