Located at the base of a mountain.
Ruined bath system.
Entrance to the Blue Mountain realm through Iron Doors.
It cannot be opened from the outside.
A silver skull keeps it open.

It is a hideout of petty bandits that steal from rural villages.
Their treasures are kept safe by Chaos Cultists

[Galen and Theron](../DuskmeadowFringe/GalenTheron.md) went in a few days ago.
They killed one bandit and one [aberration](../FoldedBelow/Murk.md).
They are now toys in the hands of the [grotesque](../FoldedBelow/ChaosChampion.md).
Their new pets.
