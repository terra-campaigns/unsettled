To the west of the [Duskmeadow Fringe](../DuskmeadowFringe/index.md), high on the northern slopes.
The wind comes hard.
So do the stares.

Folk here speak little and watch long.
Their homes are thick-walled, low, and moss-wrapped—built more to withstand silence than siege.
They say the trees to the east weren’t always there, and that something rides beneath their roots, pressing closer every year.

No inns.
No welcomes.
Only dogs, fences, and shutters that close before sundown.
