1: what the skulls on his necklace are from
From the villagers in the Northern mountains (between Fort Duhrin and the Druid Monastery), who were producing too much.

2: Is he actually related to all farmers/ the monastery of the elder way?
Not to all the farmers. But the right ones in Wyrmbark. He fathers children from selected brides from the villages. The Monastery takes some of his children when needed.

3: how old he is (do giants live longer)
Hundreds of years old.

4: where he is from
From here. His kin has always lived south of the Old One.

5: If there are more of his kind 
Not that he knows.

6: how he speaks to the animals /plants?
By speaking their tong. He has taught the Druids and the Witch of Nevask how to do so too.

7: and what are the animals/plants talking about.
That humans just take too much.

8: How do animals/plants talk (like do they have large vocabulary or not)?
They are able to communicate simple concepts. Not with phrases like people do. It is more like music.

3m giant, from the legends of the Hairy Druids of the Big Ford.

- Loves tricks and laughter—may lure you to a cliff just for the joy of it.
- It will protect sheep and shepherds, chasing off wolves or warning of avalanches.
- Breaks into cabins, eats your stew, drinks your wine, and takes your clothes—if you stay still.
- Kidnaps human brides, treats them tenderly, mourns his dead children, and guards his domain with fury.
- Senses intruders instantly—his knowledge of his land is uncanny and complete.
- His body may give rise to oak trees, suggesting he returns to the earth in death.
- Violent yet protective, joyful yet tragic, he is a force of nature with fur and mind.
- Cursed a mountain village northwest of the [Big Ford](ElderWay.md) for producing beyond their needs.
