From the legends of the Hairy Druids of the Big Ford.

- Loves tricks and laughter—may lure you to a cliff just for the joy of it.
- It will protect sheep and shepherds, chasing off wolves or warning of avalanches.
- Breaks into cabins, eats your stew, drinks your wine, and takes your clothes—if you stay still.
- Kidnaps human brides, treats them tenderly, mourns his dead children, and guards his domain with fury.
- Senses intruders instantly—his knowledge of his land is uncanny and complete.
- His body may give rise to oak trees, suggesting he returns to the earth in death.
- Violent yet protective, joyful yet tragic, he is a force of nature with fur and mind.
- Cursed a mountain village northwest of the Big Ford for producing beyond their needs.
