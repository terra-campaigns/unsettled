> Adopted by the Hairy Druids of the Big Ford.

An odd birthmark, a strange smell: somehow, the touch of elsewhere still lingers. Wherever you are, you have trouble fitting in.

You are short with marked skin and wavy hair. You have a bony face and your speech is formal. You are dressed in frayed clothing. You are merciful but also aggressive. You are 24 years old.

**Who took you in?**
The monks of a secluded forest monastery in the [Wyrmbark](index.md). When their rules became too strict, you snuck away. Take a Monk’s Habit (warm, petty) and a Spellbook of Control Plants. Control Plants: Nearby plants and trees obey you and gain the ability to move at a slow pace. Leaves grow along the spine, and it smells faintly of decay.

**What keeps bad tidings at bay?**
Pipeweed - Your good luck charm. Conversations tend to flow more easily after a smoke. 6 uses.

Take Cyrus’s place at the Earthen Council. You wear a Gravel Ring (petty) forged from pebbles and soil. When placed against stone, faint voices argue in chorus.

Big Ford Druidic Monastery of the Elder Way.
They are hairy.
They are good with farming. Legend say they learned directly from the [Basajaun](Basajaun.md).
