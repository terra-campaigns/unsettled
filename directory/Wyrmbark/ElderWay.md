- Kilometres long and wide ford and shallow river
- Many islands and floating farms
- Druids learned farming from the [Basajaun](Basajaun.md)
- Wear thorns and brambles on their massive hairy heads
- Druids are big and hairy
- A group of them wants to leave the monastery, seeking the Old One of [Kaldhur](../Kaldhur/index.md).
- Part of their population is made of migrants from other villages.
