They established at the big ford because of it's safety, with a circular hill overseeing the region.
Run by a gifted druid, and many wise men and women in the matters of nature.

Best farming knowledge in the region.

- Kilometres long and wide ford and shallow river
- Many islands and floating farms
- Druids learned farming from the [Basajaun](Basajaun.md)
- Wear thorns and brambles on their massive hairy heads
- Druids are big and hairy
- A group of them left the monastery, seeking the Old One of [Kaldhur](../Kaldhur/index.md). They were never seen again: Poppy, a friendly teenager.
- Part of their population is made of migrants from other villages.
- Pepper, a wise councillor
