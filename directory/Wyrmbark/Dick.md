A man in his thirties, flabby, weathered with long hair. An elongated face, whispering voice. Filthy Clothes and watershoes. He's honorable and deceitful.

**Traits:** Carrying a stone flute ( can calm almost any river, and is a bodyguard.

**Bond:** Mischievious Spirit. You consumed a mischievious spirit, that wreaks havoc on your insides, demanding to be taken home, deep in the woods. It occupies one slot but absorbs one Fatigue each day. It wants you alive ( for now )
