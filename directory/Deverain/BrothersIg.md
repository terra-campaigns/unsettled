The Brothers Ig are tanners and leatherworkers, but the real reason to visit them is
to glimpse the record book they are
compiling. They've made a hobby of interviewing
hunters returning from the Kalduhr,
and documenting the strange beasts they've
encountered. They pay one coin for a good
tale, but more for something with a hide.
