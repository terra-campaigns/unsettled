You are an artisan of the arcane, a smith of subtle forces. In the crucible of your workshop, the laws that govern this world are warped to suit your needs.

You are towering with marked skin and braided hair. You have a pale face and your speech is squeaky. You are dressed in antique clothing. You are humble but also greedy. You are 35 years old.

**What went horribly wrong?**
Ridiculed for discovering how to turn gold into lead, you were a laughing stock. Take a bottle of Universal Solvent (2 uses) that dissolves anything it touches into its constituent parts.

**What alchemical marvel is the product of your latest ingenuity?**
Spark Dust - Ignites easily and quickly. Useful for starting a fire or as an incendiary device. 3 uses.

**Bond**: Seize absolute control of Kormoran’s Wheel. You hold a Clockwork Gear (petty) etched with strange runes. It ticks slowly, once every hour. You don’t know why.
