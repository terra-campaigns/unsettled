You walk the line between healer and harrower, knowing the frailty of the flesh but also the secrets that lie within. With the right tools, life and death are merely words.

You are statuesque with oily skin and wavy hair. You have a sharp face and your speech is booming. You are dressed in antique clothing. You are gregareous but also lazy. You are 40 years old.

**How have you “improved” yourself?**
One arm is fully metal and comes off at the shoulder. It can be used as a weapon (d8, bulky when not attached) and can move independently if you are within sight of it.

**What rare tool is essential to your work?**
Pneuma Pump - Portable iron lungs (bulky). Enables life-saving surgery or underwater breathing.

**Bond**: Resurrect the Cult of Derawan. You found a Bone Sigil (petty) under your pillow after dreaming of fire. If buried in the earth, mushrooms proliferate around it.
