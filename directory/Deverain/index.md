Northern hills become flatter and flatter towards the coast.
The river opens its mouth in a delta, which floods the entire region around the town.
Patches of forests have been cleared, and some marshland has been dried.
The town expands with farms to the west.

Fishermen live in cabins by old decks north of the town.
Town smells of sewage, salt, and raisins and has hordes of rats and cockroaches.
Deverain is not built atop bygone ruins, like the other villages or the region.
It has a beautiful style.

People speak a southern dialect here.
But most can communicate with villagers from the north.

## Hooks in Deverain

### Fourth Kingdom

The Duke’s outward obsession with banquets and winemaking are merely a cover for his true ambition: a kingdom of his own. If he
can secure the loyalties of the monarchs in Naganeh and Tirollis, he’ll have the backing he needs to declare himself king and remove himself from under the thumb of Ambaret. He may even grant significant land rights to those willing to declare their allegiance now.

### The Piper

That joyful song in the woods? That’s the Piper! They play their flute to call us to join the revolution! We will throw off our chains as we dance! Let us set Deverain ablaze and birth a better world from its ashes!
