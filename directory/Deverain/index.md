role: Coastal Town, Duchy of the Kaldhur
status: 

hooks:
- Forth Kingdom. The Duke’s outward obsession with banquets and winemaking are merely a cover for his true ambition - a kingdom of his own. If he can secure the loyalties of the monarchs in Naganeh and Tirollis, he’ll have the backing he needs to declare himself king and remove himself from under the thumb of Ambaret. He may even grant significant land rights to those willing to declare their allegiance now.
- The piper. That joyful song in the woods? That’s the Piper! They play their flute to call us to join the revolution! We will throw off our chains as we dance! Let us set Deverain ablaze and birth a better world from its ashes!

Northern hills become flatter and flatter towards the coast.
The river opens its mouth in a delta, which floods the entire region around the town.
Patches of forests have been cleared, and some marshland has been dried.
The town expands with farms to the west.

Fishermen live in cabins by old decks north of the town.
The town smells of sewage, salt, and raisins and has hordes of rats and cockroaches.
Deverain is not built atop bygone ruins, like the other villages or the region.
It has a beautiful style.

People speak a southern dialect here.
But most can communicate with villagers from the north.
Deverainers find the northern villages untrustworthy.
They believe those villagers commune with forest spirits.

Before becoming a territory of the [Crown](../Ambaret/index.md), this land
was forest. It was cleared for farmland, though the old flora and fauna continue to find their
way back and attempt to take root. The Duke’s "Road" leads out of Deverain,
heading directly to Fort Duhrin, through rivers and trails. However, the continual growth of the forest means that the
road passes through a sliver of the Kalduhr's sister woods, making it dangerous for those carrying supplies to
the fort or bringing newly unearthed artefacts to Deverain.

Sweet smell of the winery

The Pipers set the western town ablaze in September 1025.
Farms are destroyed, and grains to be exported sink in the sea.

Oct 25 Duque acts with violence against the revolutionaries of the region.
