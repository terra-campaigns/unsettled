- _Retirement Home_: Everyone, including yourself, appears to be rapidly aging (but only to you). But with age comes wisdom. Add d6 to CTRL (max 18), but remove d2 from STR.

- _Progeny:_ Something is growing inside of you. Hope has long since abandoned it, and

it has no more room for dreams. Roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP
