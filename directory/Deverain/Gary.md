Barber-Surgeon: You walk the line between healer and harrower, knowing the frailty of the flesh but also the secrets that lie within. With the right tools, life and death are merely words. 

Garriout is lanky with tanned skin and volumes  but messy hair. He has a weathered face and his speech is formal. He is dressed in frumpy clothing. He likes to collect weird creatures and magical trinkets. He is 55 years old. He was kicked out of the academy he worked at for unorthodox teaching methods and now travels the world in a relentless pursuit of knowledge.

**How have you “improved” yourself?**
One arm is fully metal and comes off at the shoulder. It can be used as a weapon (d8, bulky when not attached) and can move independently if you are within sight of it. 

**What rare tool is essential to your work?**
Graftgrub - A small worm that can fuse inanimate objects with parts of the body. 1 use. 

Bond: One of your ancestors wronged a Moss Witch, who cursed their bloodline. Your visage causes mirrors to shatter. You’ve noticed that the shards can sometimes reveal illusions.

Gary is [Lorenz](../DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md)'s far uncle.
He has lost his arm in the [Western Swamp](../FeverSwamp/index.md).
