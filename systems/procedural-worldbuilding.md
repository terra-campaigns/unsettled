# Hexes

Each hex is 8h long.
Hexes are measured as the time it takes to cross them on foot, and not their actual length.

## Populating hexes (TWEI)

Roll 5d6 and discard the highest.
Use 4d6 for weirder areas, 6d6 for boring areas.

**(T) Topography:** Verticality of terrain.
**(W) Water:** Wetness.
**(E) Ecology:** Non-human life.
**(I) Infrastructure:** Buildings, roads and human stuff.

**1=1** Trace
**2=2** Some
**3=3** Lots
**4=N** Null, actively none - perhaps by design
**5=H** Hazardous - not through lack or excess, but nature
**6=S** Super, off the scale - think big, then go bigger

Roll 1d12: this is the number of hexes with the same TWEI profile.
Use MB's spark tables when needed.

### Barriers

Flat lands have 1-in-6 chance of 1 barrier.
Hilly and swamp lands have 2-in-6 chance of 1 or 2 barriers.
Mountain lands have 3-in-6 chance of 1 to 3 barriers.

Roll a d6 and count clockwise to know where the barrier is.

# Myths

Myths are 2d6kH away from each other, in a random direction (roll d6 and count clockwise).

## Encounters

Encounters should be based on the Myths roll defined for the session.
Alternatively, use [Just-bears-etc](Just-bears-etc.html).
