A land draped in rot and memory,  
where moss-fed ruins whisper beneath the fog.

The bones of a dead civilisation jut from hillsides and riverbeds —  
arches half-sunken, towers halved by time, their makers forgotten.

### Parade of the First Snow

Legend has it that the ancestors of the northern
Levasti were starving hunter-gatherers
when fortune shone upon them and showed
large animal prints in the fresh snow. These
prints led to a herd of grazing animals which
they gorged upon. After this successful hunt,
the tribe settled here. The villagers now show
their respect to their ancestors by awaking at
daybreak and marching in pairs through the
fresh snow in large boots shaped like hooves.

### Feast of All Saints

The various traditions of Ambaret are often celebrated in the northern villages as well.
Whereas this festival is an introspective and sombre affair in the capital, families in the countryside celebrate with joy. Perhaps away from the heavy hand of the Crown, the people feel freer to enjoy themselves, or possibly there is just less concern about offending the [Church of the Weeping Mother](../directory/weepingMother/index.md) by celebrating some lesser-known Sisters.

Some of the wine and cider made from berries and grapes in September spoil quickly. The best are stored and will survive winter. The sour ones are drunk in abundance at the Feast of All Saints.

### Mortunt

Mortunt is an end of year evening affair celebrated in
rural communities where brewing and gambling
are primary pastimes. Now, it’s mostly
a night where revelers gather around massive
bonfires, drinking and making merry before
going off in groups of two or three to “kill
Death” (or, really, do whatever small groups
of young people might do during a night of
debauchery). What’s mostly forgotten is the
origin of the holiday: a tale of three brothers
who, in a state of drunken paranoia, set
a bounty on Death herself. The group was
found dead in a ditch the next morning. Their
friends tried to “avenge” their deaths in each
of the following years by hunting after Death
herself. Rumor is that no one’s collected that
bounty yet, and so the festival continues.
