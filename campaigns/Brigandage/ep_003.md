## More pets

[Wilmot](../../directory/Deverain/Wilmot.md) and [Basil](../../directory/Deverain/Basil.md) meet a new adventurer, Falcon, and decide to deal with the howling princes in the well inside the [abandoned bath](../../directory/FoldedBelow/BanditsBath.md).

They are attacked by enraged, and maybe possessed or drugged, [metallic humanoid bugs](../../directory/FoldedBelow/Bugbears.md).
The group manages to burn one of the bugs with oil, and the others run away in fear, resulting in one casualty in the group.

The adventurers go by the well.
They are well prepared for the noise, and with a bucket of oil, burn the corpses of the princes inside the well.
A [heavily robed man](../../directory/FoldedBelow/ChaosChampion.md) watches them from a distance.
In confusion, the men get into a fight with the robbed figures, who fight back strongly.

No human is left alive to tell this story.
