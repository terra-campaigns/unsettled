[Galen and Theron](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/GalenTheron.md) are rural villagers, vassals to the [Mountain Court](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md), in the [Duskmeadow Fringe](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/index.md).
Their obligations to the court have become heavier, and the village elders decided to send them both to a known bandit lair.
Those bandits have stolen from travellers and other villagers, and now they are disposing of their goods anyway.

After speaking with [crows](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/TheChoir.md) and learning that four princes must be buried, the couple finished their travel to the local lair.
Beneath a [ruined bathhouse](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/BanditsBath.md), they found an old iron door held ajar by a silver skull.

They fought a [three-headed creature](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Murk.md) inside it.
The adventurers killed a bandit and, later, a [hairy animal](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Bugbears.md).
They met a [grotesque](../../directory/FoldedBelow/ChaosChampion.md), who showed them the bandit's stash.
The grotesque said one had to stay here since they had slain his pets.

Galen did not think through when he threw their torch at the grotesque.
Their light is gone.
Galen and Theron are now the grotesque's pets.
