## Meeting the Brothers Ig

It is a warm summer day.
[Deverain](../../directory/Deverain/index.md) is bustling with grain export activities from the northern villages, vassals to the crown.
[Basil](../../directory/Deverain/Basil.md) and [Wilmot](../../directory/Deverain/Wilmot.md), two local low-men, meet the tanners, [Brothers Ig](../../directory/Deverain/BrothersIg.md), who love weird tales and their hides.

## Abandoned Bath

Following rumours, the two low men travel to the abandoned [Bath](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/BanditsBath.md).
An iron door with a silver skull is kept open.
Both door and skull are covered in runes.
Basil concludes the skull is some key.

Inside, they find the corpses of a man and a creature that looks like [a brutish man with two heads growing from its middle head](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Murk.md).
Going further on that path, they find two of the same creatures, smoking something that makes a yellow smoke.
The low men throw some food for them, but cannot communicate with them.

Choosing the corridor to the other side, they find a subterranean river.
To one side, a chamber is full of what looks like a carnivorous fungus.
Continuing ahead, they are met with a deafening noise.
They find that the sound comes from four princes' bodies, inside a well.

The low men have a plan of burning the bodies in an attempt to make them silent.
The sight of [one person](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/GalenTheron.md), with two small heads growing from them, and then a few silent, [heavily robed men](../../directory/FoldedBelow/ChaosChampion.md), scared the low-men away.
They left the cavern carrying the silver skull.
