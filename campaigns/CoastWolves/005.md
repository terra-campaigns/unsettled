We are attacked by these living dead from the sea.
Faraldr is badly hurt, and Leikr only got scratches.
Luckily, we can outrun them and still be alive.

We travel south but quickly get lost again.
We cannot find the river we thought we would.
We walk until night, and do not find the sea.
We have no food, and barely sleep under such a storm.

The next morning starts with fog.
We find one wrecked karvi.
And the sea to our north and east.
We are completely lost.

From the karvi, we get a fishing net and start fishing on the coast.
We find fish and hack the karvi to make camp.

For the first time in many mornings, we wake up dry and not too cold.
It is still foggy.
We walk south and southeast for two watches.
We find a giant, digging in the sand.

We can sneak behind him and charge for an attack.
The giant walks into the sea, and we keep hacking at him.
He is covered in blood, but does not stop.
Once deep enough, he picks up a boulder and throws it at Faraldr.

But then the giant falls as a tree being felled.
He displaces water, and water washes us to the sand.
He floats, and his blood clouds the water.
