I tell the man that we ought to be on the good side of King Ulfr.
Nothing better than killing a giant here in [Albann](../../gazetteer/Albann.md).
Then we can ask for the best loot.
We sleep in a stable, with beasts of burden, before we leave, before first light.

We wake up to heavy rain.
We postpone our incursion.

The next day, we depart fresh under just fog.
We see a hurt wolf.
I respect wolves and take my time to help the animal.
We sleep under the stars.

The next morning, we are greeted by drizzle.
We were lost in the fog, as I couldn't see the coast.

Gaetir points at a group of soldiers.
They are well armed.
They are Norsemen returning to York.
They tell us of the giant that it leaves in the north.

We sleep again and wake up to a storm.
We travel southeast and search for the wrecks at the coast.
We see a group of people.
They seem to be the people that went into the sea a few days ago.
