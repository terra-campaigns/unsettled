I helped fund this great voyage.
We set sail with twelve *ármenn* — rowers — aboard my *karvi*.
Together, many *karvis* crossed the seas, chasing gold and glory.
We aimed for [Albann](../../gazetteer/Albann.md), land of fine churches and soft men.
Their wealth called to me like the voice of a *nornir*.

The men with me had no silver.
They pledged their oaths to row.
I led.
They followed.

Long days at sea.
Salt wind. Oars creaking.
Hope in our hearts.
Then — *stormr*.
A wrathful sea.
Our ships shattered.
The sky turned black.
And then — nothing.

I wake.
Salt on my lips.
Sand in my mouth.
I lie on a [pale beach](../../gazetteer/Hwicce/index.md).
Morning is grey.
Wreckage everywhere — splintered hulls, driftwood, tattered sails.

Bodies in the surf.
Two... three...
The waves take them, then give them back.
Blood darkens the sand.

I see a shattered *karvi* to the north.
Shrubland stretches inland.
Chalk hills beyond.

I run to a body.
No breath.
Dead.

I turn to the next, the one not bleeding.
I now notice:
My beard is thick with salt;
My limbs ache;
Thirst burns my throat.
But I move.

I lie down a moment.
Then rise.
The third body — impaled.
He coughs. Blood.
Gerska.

I pull the timber.
He screams.
Gulls scatter into the sky.

I press a cloth to his wound.
He grips my arm.
“Ubbe?” he whispers.
“No. Herleif, son of Herlaug.”

He smiles faintly.
A breath. A nod.
“We were close. I’m glad you live.”
“No, Gerska. We are there.”

His voice fades.
He speaks names of our men:
Ubbe, Gismund, Kolbjorn, Oddi, Rodfos, Randver.
And women:
Signhild, Jofrid.

“May Odin take your soul,” I say.
Gerska frowns.
“I did not die in battle. I’ll never see Valhalla.”

In the surf, I find a barrel.
I heave it ashore, smash it open.
Freshwater. I drink deep.

More wrecks along the coast.
More dead.
Three... four more bodies.

South — smoke. A column rising.

I check the bodies first.
Dead. All.

Tracks in the sand — two or three sets, heading south.
I wade into the surf, retrieve a shield and scattered gear.
Then I follow the tracks.

A fire ahead.
Four shapes by it.
Voices — *norrœnt mál*. Our tongue.

They are:
Ake, Faraldr, Gaetir, Leikr.

We speak. We count the dead.
We gather what we can.
Seven more *ármenn* found, still alive.

No enemy. No village.
Only stone, sea, and sky.

We make camp.
We sleep.
