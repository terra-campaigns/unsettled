*YOU DIED.  
BUT THIS IS NOT THE END.  
YOU WAKE ON GREY SANDS.   
A VISTA OF BLACK PITTED STONE AND SCABBED ORANGE IRON LIES IN FRONT OF YOU.  
EMBEDDED IN YOUR FLESH IS A BLACK STONE INSCRIBED WITH YOUR SINS.  
YOU REMEMBER NOTHING BUT YOUR NAME.  
WILL YOU BE BROKEN BY THE SHRIKE.*

## What is this?

- Open table for <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/de/product/501615/the-shrike" target="_blank">Leo Hunt’s The Shrike</a>. A pointcrawl set in a lost section of hell. 
- You play characters trapped in hell. 

(If you played in the unsettled Cairn campaign, you may choose to play a deceased character. If you’d like to bring one from another campaign, just ask. Or you can play a new character. This has no mechanical impact. You will roll for stats and items anyways.) 

## Theme, Rules and Playstyle

- Theme: Dark fantasy but not grimdark.
- System: Rules light framework based on <a href="https://jasontocci.itch.io/grave" target="_blank">Grave by Jason Tocci</a>. Rules reference document for the campaign <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1060840338777964565/1471336719486943343" target="_blank">here</a>
- Playstyle: High trust OSR, Problem-solving, non-authorial, world-favoring.
- No generative AI (draw yourself, search the public domain).
- Safety: Open door policy, lines and veils (dm the referee), x card. 

## How do we play?

- Online, using Discord (video optional) and Owlbear as VTT.
- Weekly sessions, open table, first come first serve.
- No downtime between sessions. Characters not available are usually assumed to follow the party at a distance.
- Session reports posted to campaign blog (LINK to be added). After action reports, maps and illustrations by players awarded with bonus XP.
