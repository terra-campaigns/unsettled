You are a mere digit on the unerring hand of justice. You go where others fear to tread, unyielding and unbroken.

You have a Stout Physique, Scarred Skin, and Bald Hair. Your Face is Broken, your Speech Droning. You have Livery Clothing. You are Gregarious and Vengeful. You are 25 years old.

**Bond:** An entertainer once visited your home, filling it with story and song. He left without a word one day, leaving only A Miniature Lute behind. Something rattles inside.
