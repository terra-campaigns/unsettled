A group of adventurers from [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md) investigates the witch of Drythwyn Weald.
On the 27th, they were [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Stone](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Stone.md), [Vihero](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Vihero.md) and [Moun Cacalou](../../directory/Sigisfarne/MounCacalou.md).
On the 3rd of the following month, they were [Indigo](../../directory/Deverain/Indigo.md), [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Stone](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Stone.md), [Vihero](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Vihero.md) and [Gerrik](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Gerrik.md).

They go North along the river, arriving at a large birch-like tree.
Seemingly growing out from the trunk itself is a rope that stretches perfectly horizontally, visible past the West.

On Razzy's night shift, the forest starts to come alive with noises - hoots, bird cries, howls.
The trees cast shadows in the dim moonlight, making it quite hard to see.
From one moment to the next, the sound of ragged, laboured breathing becomes all too familiar.
Sounds muffled, like coming through wet rags.
A deep, sulfuric stench that leaves a strong aftertaste.
 
A silhouette describes what is not there, rather than what is.
A low, slight, animal-sized humanoid form, moving parallel to the camp.
 
Razzy, in fear, moves to wake Vihero.
The ragged breathing is interrupted, producing a sound akin to a slobbering dog flapping its lips.
A slight pause of sniffing the air, and then a sharp scream of agony.

Razzy pees herself at the scream, pulling her dagger out as she backs up to Stone in a defensive position.

Everyone wakes up.

The creature starts to breathe again.
Slow-paced, muffled footsteps.
Stone starts to play the happy song on the reed whistle as Moun lights her torch.

The creature pauses for some time.
Another sound of slobbering again, before the sounds of breathing slowly and gradually start to subside.

As time passes, dawn starts to break.
The birds begin to chirp, and things gradually go back to normal.
That is, except for a vague trail in the position where the creature was that night.
The grass is taller, denser, and a darker green colour, heading roughly southwest to northeast.

Stone brings his compass to the rope to test whether it messes with its direction, but nothing of note happens.
