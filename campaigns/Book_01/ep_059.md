## Meeting the Grotesque

A group of villagers returns to the [Underground Temple](../../directory/FoldedBelow/UndergroundTemple.md) they went the week before.
They are [Artea](../../directory/Wyrmbark/Artea.md), [Waximillian](../../directory/Deverain/Gary.md), [Oswin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Oswin.md), [Seren](../../directory/KAW/Seren.md), [Pela Croftman](../../directory/Ambaret/PelaCroftman.md) and [Beatrix](../../directory/Deverain/Beatrix.md).
During an investigation on the lower level, the group finds themselves cornered by a large group of heavily robed, grotesque men.
They name them [mimics](../../directory/FoldedBelow/ChaosChampion.md).

The group starts by throwing a net at one of them, and a fight ensues.
One of the grotesque kills Waximilian, while Pela uses her whistle to kill one of them.
The survivor grotesque rejoins their main party.

Oswin takes the lead and negotiates their lives with them.
Their leader asks for the Blade of Memories as payment.

Once both groups are facing each other, the villagers notice that these grotesque beings are enslaving pumas.
In an act of goodness, they pay 100 coins to take one of the pumas from them and save it.
The grotesque group agrees and leaves the church level of the dungeon.

## Folding

The group continues to adventure through the caverns.
They notice that as they cross the heavy iron doors, they feel nausea, and it is as if the air is different on each side.
Artea tries her gravel ring and realises that the rocks speak with different voices too.

Ahead of them lies the [yellow smoke spa](../../directory/FoldedBelow/YellowSmoke.md) of the [Handzies](../../directory/FoldedBelow/GreenWitches.md).
To the right, the group finds a black (ceramic?) wall that appears to be a void itself.
Beatrix tests, looking at it through a mirror: she sees an inaccessible ballroom, with nobles dancing and drinking.

Continuing to the right of this wall, the cave ceiling is higher.
In front, from a tall escarpment, some people throw rocks at the group.

The villagers return, and take the last cavern tunnel.
At the end of it, they see an exit.
It is a forested area.
A large forest, nothing like the ones they have around their villages.

> *Where is this?*  

They think.
