## Ugly images

The [insect centaurs](../../directory/FoldedBelow/Hippareiones.md) are excited and anxious for the party to open the east door.
They seem unable to do so themselves.
Once Drake opens it, all three flee as fast as they can towards a dark cavern.
They leave the [underground temple](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/UndergroundTemple.md).

[Drake](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Drake.md) and [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) go to the other side of the door.
It has images of the fat woman from the statue above in different positions.
The door has some enchantment, but the party cannot open it from the outside.
Their voices are also not heard.

[Yarrow](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Yarrow.md) keeps the group moving and navigates towards the northern cavern.
In the first chamber, a carving of a mollusc eating a man.
They see some dim light from another chamber further north.

## A beautiful image

The walls are covered in bioluminescent fungi.
In the middle lies a marble statue of a saint.
The group recognise her as one of the [Weeping Mother](../../directory/weepingMother/index.md)'s [Sisters](../../directory/weepingMother/theSisters.md).
This statue seems dragged from the cathedral through the broken wall.

When [Indigo](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Indigo.md) tries to move the statue, he sees a vision of one of [the Sisters](../../directory/weepingMother/theSisters.md).
But it quickly disappears.

## Fighting Reptiloids

The group goes to the room where the insect centaurs were mating before.
They climb a spiral stone staircase and navigate tight corridors.
It ends in a wall of glass mosaic.
Yarrow finds out that this wall is moveable and gives access to the room with the fat woman statue.

Around the pit trap, they see several muddy footprints.
A few of them go into a wall up a flight of stairs.
The wall is also moveable, and the group finds a [reptiloid](../../directory/FoldedBelow/Reptiloids.md).
It eats human limbs in a corner and quickly warns the others, who come from the main entrance.

Three repitiloids start hostility against the adventurers who invaded their space.
They seem to have magical powers, like Razzy.
They squeak and grunt when the group ambush them on the spiral staircase.
In the end, they are bested by the adventurers.

## A pile of gems

The group finds a trapped, locked door where the repitloid was eating human limbs.
They are unable to open it or fully disable the trap.

Going south, the group finds a large pile of gems.
Carefully, Yarrow pokes it, and innumerable worms attack the group.
Yarrow falls, then Indigo and shortly after Drake.
Razzy bravely sets them on fire with two torches and is pleased to have saved everyone.

The worms remind the drawings around the woman's images.
Most gems in the pile are fake, but the group can collect some valuable ones.

## Epilogue

Before leaving, the adventurers look at the tunnels west and east of the cathedral.
To the west, a collapsed corridor hides an iron door.
To the east, a long cavern ends in a large pool of water to the northeast.
This is where the insect centaurs went.

The pool becomes deep quickly.
A large iron door (almost a small iron gate) is in this same chamber.
Under inspection, there are no traps, but it is closed, has no handle and does not move with force. 
There are no signs of the creatures.
