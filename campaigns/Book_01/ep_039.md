## Prologue 

[Ayrrin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Ayrrin.md) takes a fugitive woman and her 7-year-old son from their violent man, in [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md), to the [Monastery of the Elder Way](../../directory/Wyrmbark/ElderWay.md).
She travels with [Nyx](../../directory/Perdut/Nyx.md), who recognises the mountains up north from her visions upon seeing the ford.
With them also comes [Soren](../../directory/Kryptwood/Soren.md), still handling a long hangover from so much drinking with the villagers, and [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), thinking of options for the Fae folk that might be at risk in the hands of men from the south.
They met [Gary](../../directory/Deverain/Gary.md), who was also travelling upriver, to meet his nephew [Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md).

## Rainy weather

As they travel upriver towards [Fort Duhrin](../../directory/Kaldhur/FortDuhrin.md), the weather turns bad with torrential rain.
They navigate the boat up to the [burning tree](../../directory/Kaldhur/BurningTree.md).
As navigation is difficult in the overflowing river, they tie up the boat and decide to investigate the tree and its surroundings.

The tree has no leaves, and its inside burns like golden melted rock.
Inside it are seven tiny golden bells, tied to the internal walls.
Soren throws an arrow in one of the bells, which chimes like another bell, inside the barn of the [Rabbit's Inn](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/RabbitInn.md).
Beside the tree are a few round rocks, and a worn hat lies in the ground.

In the vicinity of the tree, one hour into the tree line of the nearby woods, the group finds a lost waystation.

## Exploring the area

After sleeping at the waystation, the rain does not let up.
Given the difficulty of navigating upriver in this weather, the group decides to explore the area further.
They travel north towards the flooded river amongst forest hills.
They then turn southeast and continue downhill.

Nyx finds a carving knife, of simple make but with a sharp blade.
She keeps it to herself.
The group is forced to negotiate a thicket with the forest, and sleeps under it to protect from the nonstop rain.
During the night, crows and branches chat in the sound of the woods.

The next day comes with more rain.
Nyx finds a carved crow in her belongings.
Soaked for a long time, the group is tired and makes mistakes, travelling slightly north instead of just west to go back to the burning tree.
It takes time, but they can find their way to their boat.

But navigating the river is still impossible, weren't for...

## Grandad of the Farmers

They see downriver the [Basajaun](../../directory/Wyrmbark/Basajaun.md).
Razzy and Ayrrin introduce him as the 'Grandad'.
The giant is happy to meet the adventurers on a nice, wet day.
He is happy to pull their boat upriver, closer to the Fort.

One and a half days later, they disembark on the river bend, half a day from the fort.
On their way, Soren finds the horseshoe of some large horse.
The item is well-made and holds the crown's icons.
Later in the morning, they arrive at the fort.

## Epilogue

Gary leaves Fort Durhim the next day (2nd Nov-Accorns) and follows [the Wall](../../directory/Wall/index.md), travelling south until he finds an abandoned military road.
He ignores all the warnings of a dangerous place that people would have given him before departing.
