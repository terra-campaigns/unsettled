## In the church kitchen

[Varg](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Varg.md), [Gunther](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Gunther.md) and [Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md) have always lived under the [Mountain Court](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md) rule.
These newly arrived travellers were their best chance of leaving their damned village.
Before the sunrise, they follow the rumours and ask the priest to speak with the people sleeping in the church.
[Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) and [Stone](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Stone.md) explain they want to help Lord Derron's daughter, and with that help [Middle Waters](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/MiddleWatersMinster.md).

The sun rises, and [Lord Griffin](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/LordGriffin.md) comes to the door.
He and his bodyguards accompany the travellers to the palace.
The palace is colourful and full of animals, lords and ladies.
It is not only strange that animals live amongst people, but the lords and ladies all carry some bestial aspect on them.

Lord Derron agrees to let the group visit his daughter.
He names two bodyguards to go with the group up the cave.
It is a 2-hour walk up the mountain.
The villagers recognise this as the cave where the monthly sacrifices take place.

## A lady in a cave

The cave has iron gates on its entrance.
Within, smell and stains of blood, and an intense buzzing noise.
Many cells with iron bars inside.
In one of the cells is Lady Amelia

She has been in a bestial form for months, with insect wings and a bee's eyes.
She feels her father has put her here and does not care for her.
He has never come since she is in the cave.
She hears other lords and ladies come to take their bestial form under the full moon, but they all go back to the court after, and she does not.

Upon investigation, the barber-surgeon found a large area of her body bitten by bees.
However, the guard explains that she has always had aspects of bees, but they have become more prominent recently.
Lady Amelia thinks she was bitten by bees by the lake, to the west.

## Ambush

The group returns to the palace and explains that they want to go to the lake to investigate.
Lord Derron becomes afraid that the Court's secret will be revealed and trusts any solution from the travellers.
He tells them three bodyguards will accompany them, but they intend to ambush the group.

In a trail corner, the guards try to take Razzy down.
They are not lucky enough to finish her fast, and allowed the group to retribute.
Stone plays his peace tune, which stops the fight.

The guards, one of whom was hurt, suggested letting the group go.
They will report back to Lord Derron that the travellers were killed and their bodies dropped in the river.
