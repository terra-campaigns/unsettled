Very hot and foggy weather prevents the group from travelling to the [Titan Spire](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/SkySpire.md) in the early morning of the first day of Grain harvests.
The group spends a day with [Oswin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Oswin.md) and the five-year-old child whom the Hexenbane once adopted.
[Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) intends to replace this kid with a goblin, binding the people of Sigisfarne and the [forest fairies](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Queensweald.md).

## A new liege lord

After a week of inspections, [Lord Griffin](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/LordGriffin.md) announces that Sigisfarne is no longer a direct vassal of the [Ambaret](../../directory/Ambaret/index.md)'s seat.
The village has [failed](ep_004.md) to pay adequate tributes this year.
The new liege lord will be the [Mountain Court](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md).

The first order of Lord Griffin is to increase the tributes due in one stone, per ten stones.
This act will help relieve the famine in the region.
Lord Griffin then appoints a new delegate - [Jock](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Jock.md), now a Subvicar.

Lazlo tells the villagers that a similar act decades ago caused the [Middle Waters Minster](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/MiddleWatersMinster.md) to experience a long-lasting famine.
Lord Griffin dismisses the monk's arguments.
The villagers, for fear and obedience, do not back Lazlo.

## Finerona comes

The group leaves the following morning.
After a few hours, [Ayrrin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Ayrrin.md) notices the group is being followed.
[Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md) remembers it would not be the first time Lord Griffin's men were sent to silence others.

In the hills, the group prepares an ambush.
Razzy hides further back, while the [Baron Von Betrüger](../../directory/Deverain/BaronVonBetrüger.md) parks his cart, pretending to sell goods.
The remaining members hide behind boulders.

Griffin's men are not easily fooled and quickly threaten the Baron.
Upon realising this, Ayrrin shoots an arrow at their leader's shoulder.
Lazlo starts a sermon, "... the [Mother](../../directory/weepingMother/index.md) will not weep for you!"
Razzy calls one of the fae names she learned: **Finerona**.

What happens next feels like a nightmare in their memories.
A small elf turns into an elven dread.
A [giant skeletal figure of darkness](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/TheHunger.md) engulfed the scene.
It has **Hunger** for those who take too much.

The group leave Griffin's men behind.
They walk, hearing their screams in agony.
But they do not turn back.

## Studying the Titan

Hours later, the scared group arrives at the spire once again.
Lazlo uses a lens device he carries to extract blood from the statue.
A viscous yellow liquid, like tree sap, is taken.
The monk then drops it into his eyes.

> *The statue had no feelings yesterday.*
> *It only sees, hears, and records observations.*
> 
> *The warm fog comes from the canyon to the northeast.*
> *Three [spider people](../../directory/FoldedBelow/SpiderPeople.md) leave the mouth of the statue and travel north*.
> *Hours later, a robbed man also travels north.*
> 
> *The man comes back first.*
> *Then the spiders.*
> *Finally, later in the day, the fog dissipates.*

The group finds a man in a robe full of mud, mould and moss inside the statue.
He toils, polishes runes, and cleans leaky ceramic pipes.
The man tells them to leave, otherwise their *blessed one* would be unhappy.
Lazlo befriends him and can collect some of his blood on the lens.

The cultist tells the monk he follows their *blessed one* - Gazuk.
They are all [followers of Filakh](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Filakh.md), the bringer of plenty.
They have to purge the land of its supernatural so Filakh can come to Gazuk and commune with them.

## Epilogue

Lazlo sees yesterday in the cultist's blood:

> *This cultist and another four, alongside a tall and fat leader (Gazuk).*
> *The cultists rhythmically pound at the heart using a wide ram to restart it.*
> *Often, they stop to pour blood (known to him to be human) into the top of the heart, before pounding it again.*
> *The heart leaks, pierced by a massive silver javelin.*
