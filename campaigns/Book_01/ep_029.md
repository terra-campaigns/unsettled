A group leaves [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md) for an incursion to the [Northern Spire](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/SkySpire.md).
[Varg](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Varg.md) feels heavy, with his stone heart, while [Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md) continues to think about what it means to get other creatures' memories.
This time, [Soren](../../directory/Kryptwood/Soren.md) comes without his flute, having lost it in the river the week before.
[Ayrrin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Ayrrin.md) thinks of her half-sister most of the way.

Before leaving, a retinue led by [Lord Griffin](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/LordGriffin.md) seeks some tax debtors.
[Indigo](../../directory/Deverain/Indigo.md) and the Riverrun [Stone](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Stone.md) are being sought.

## A giant statue, a spire, a woman

At the eroded end of the northern canyon, [found earlier](ep_025.md), the group learns that the spire stands in the hand of a fallen statue.
On the inside of the statue's broken arm, Lorenz noticed a texture not of worked stone.
It is also warm to the touch.

Their attention is grabbed by a famished woman, with crazy looks, hiding inside the spire.
Climbing a rope ladder, the adventurers speak in hushed voices with her.
She <a href="#accounts" target="_blank">explains what she has seen</a>.

Lorenz hits the statue's hand with his blue steel sword.
He remembers.

> *The statue is a Titan from the past, when an old civilisation built the region in the [Warden-Stone](../../gazetteer/Warden-Stone.md) style.
> It was placed here as a scarecrow for the terrors of the north.
> The canyon was then a dam.*
> 
> *In another memory, the canyon is dry, and the [wall](../../directory/Wall/index.md) is erected to the north.
> The Titan faced an even larger foe from the forest beyond the wall.
> A silver javelin is thrown and hits the Titan on its hand, drilling through its heart.
> Darkness.*

## Inside it

The group decides to climb down a wooden ladder, entering the mouth of the Titan. 
It is dark, and they encounter two [spider people](../../directory/FoldedBelow/SpiderPeople.md) as guards.
In confusion, unable to speak the same language, a fight ensues.

A javelin badly hurts Varg.
Soon, Lorenz and Soren fall too.
Those two would be lost if not for Ayrrin's bravery.
She kills one of the spider people, and the other flees.

The group gathered outside the statue for some quick rest before going down again.
Beyond where they fought, they see themselves in a large round room, circled with lit torches and runes in the middle.
A huge silver shaft pierces it from the ceiling to the floor.

They find a child hidden, hungry and afraid through the eastern door.
She was playing and exploring, and found herself within the statue alongside the evil men and spiders.
She meekly follows the group as they leave the location.
A small rat accompanies her and shares a secret that the big, fat man fears rats.
