[Artea](../../directory/Wyrmbark/Artea.md), [Ayrrin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Ayrrin.md), and [Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md) met up with [Soren](../../directory/Kryptwood/Soren.md) in [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md).
Although the rodent handler was hired to free Sigisfarne from the [molemen](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/PiotChant.md), they decide to go to the [Underground Temple](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/UndergroundTemple.md) first.
The group leaves the village while the village folk harvest wheat.
They travel south to the cave system that leads to the underground temple.

## Strange figures

In front of the three doors of the underground temple, Artea spends her time studying the petrified trees.
The trees are not from any of the forests of the region.
While they are at that, Soren plays his flute and summons the rats from the cave to follow him.

They hear footsteps from the darkness within the temple.
A man comes, wearing a heavy robe similar to one of the statues in the first room of the temple.
He also carries a broadsword, but does not act hostilely.
He is accompanied by a creature with [two heads attached to a normal human body's natural, but sleepy, head](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Murk.md).

The two strange figures cannot speak any known language, so they communicate with grunts and gestures.
They both look degraded, as if they were people who had never left caves for decades.
The group understands they are asking for payment, and each adventurer pays a toll of 1 gp.
They are given safe passage.

As the group advanced down into the temple, they observed the statue of the fat entity.
It has slightly moved an arm since they were here a week ago.

## The altar

The group finds a locked door.
Artea puts some seeds into the keyhole and wishes for them to grow.
As the plant fills out the hole, poison is spread in the air, numbing the adventurers' bodies and minds.

Eventually, the door lock breaks, and the group enters a room.
A single stone altar, with carvings of monsters, covers it.
Artea senses that the stone on the altar feels forgotten.

Atop the altar, a wooden mace with reptile scales.
Lorenz recognises the craftsmanship of the weapon.

## Outsiders? In? Coin?

The group follows the long cave tunnel they've seen the last few times people were in the temple.
It ends in a pool of water, and an iron door lies open to its left.
As they pass through the door, they find themselves in a cave with different natural stones, as if they are in a different location.
These stones have carvings in an unknown language, and Artea senses "the dead are not welcome".

Many footsteps in the darkness ahead.
A strange man in a lighter robe greets them.
Creatures guard him; the group names them [Anttaurs](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/SpiderPeople.md).
He can speak simple words, and the group understands that each has to pay 10 gp to go past him and his guards.

They decide to head back to Sigisfarne before venturing further.
