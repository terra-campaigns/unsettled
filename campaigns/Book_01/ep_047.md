[Stone](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Stone.md), [Gary](../../directory/Deverain/Gary.md) and [Beatrix](../../directory/Deverain/Beatrix.md) take a boat ride to [index](../../directory/Deverain/index.md).

By the end of the day, on a dark December evening, a full yellow moon rose.
A crown vessel observes the town from the bay.
"Beware of werewolves, they come from the [mountain](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md)", people think.

The group rescues a woman dressed as a noble who four ferocious hunting dogs are attacking.

*Look little dog, run away. Your friend is already dead.*    
*If little dog, you stay. We will turn your fur red.*

She is badly hurt and passes out.
Beatrix looks after her ornate dagger.

They bring the woman to an inn, where people are hiding from the moon.
The woman is treated and wakes up the next morning.
She thanks the group and gives one of her rings as a reward.
Beatrix pays for their stay with the dagger.

The noble woman introduces herself as Ole Klengel Hacke.
She lives in the Hacke Estate, and tells the group that they will be sent for to discuss her rescue with her father.

Beatrix finds a fence, a guy she knows as [Bob](../../directory/Deverain/Steffan.md) - who now calls himself Steffan.
He takes the ring and tells her the story of the sunken Empire Legion ships in the bay around Deverain.

> **THE GRAND LEGION’S SHIPS**
> During the last imperial invasion, the Grand Legion’s ships were scuttled by saboteurs, leaving all their cargo at the bottom of the sea. The wrecks should still be intact because no sailor will go near the area due to rumours that the legionnaires’ spirits haunt the waves.


The group decides to sleep in the boathouse and save some coin.
They wake up snowed in.
The first snow of the winter is hard - a storm.

The next day, no one comes to pick up the group.
And no one has ever heard of the Hacke Estate.
After the snow melts, it is also nowhere to be found.
