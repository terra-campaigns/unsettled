## Day 4th of Jan-Feast of 1026 of our Great Mother,

The first expeditions into the wall have taken place. The first party got lost and has not been seen for a week. The other expedition went in yesterday. The members were:

* [Obeha Ashenroot](../../directory/Ambaret/ObehaAshenroot.md), a priestly figure. 
* [Gary](../../directory/Deverain/Gary.md), the scholar who assisted in claiming our fortress
* Bob, a local smith apprentice
* Ogel, a mercenary out of Deverain
* Later joined by [Pebble](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Pebble.md)]

They returned a few hours later bringing some good and some ill tidings. 
Apperently, the main route into the wall goes directly through some kinds of stone people territory. They don't seem overtly hostile, so we will try to set up negotiations and open a more direct route. 

The group reported going into the eastern part of the top level, there they found signs of the old adventuring party but also signs of goblins. There they lost Bob in the scuffle. His body has not been found. 

The old adventuring party was found walking as shambling zombies on the second level. There corpses remain in the dungeon, but at least they don't shamble anymore. Their leader is still missing, might be somewhere deeper in the dungeon. 

The party returned bringing some found treasure. 260 gold pieces worth, not a scrappy haul for a first time.

Parody of "Another brick in the wall, pt 2" by Pink Floyd: 

We first need some information  
We then need Bob and Ogel  
No dark chasm’s, torch in the gloom  
Creature, skin is made of stone   

Hey, creature, leave us guys alone  

All in all, we’re just another prick in the wall  
All in all, you're just another hick in the wall  

We would need the right direction  
We don't need impulse control  
Eight green goblins in the last room  
creatures, leave us all you own  

Hey, creature, leave us please alone!

All in all, you're just another prick in the wall  
All in all, we’re just another flick in the wall  

-conversation-
Wrong, Bob down again  
Quick, we flee again  
If you don't eat my meat, I can have any gold bling  
(wrong, flute failed again)  
How can I have any ca-ching if I don't hit your meat?  
(Strong, hit it again)  
(If you get knocked of your feet)  
You, yes, you behind the corpse shreds, stand still, laddie  
(If you don't pay your deed, you can't leave here standing)  
(How can you have any red tome if you don't let us lead?)  
(You, yes, you will bind the deal lads, now go, laddie)
