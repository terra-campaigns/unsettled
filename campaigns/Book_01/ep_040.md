## Prologue 

[Gary](../../directory/Deverain/Gary.md) finds Master Tarmac's camp on the second night.

## A success

> A success! A great success. The expedition towards the wall went splendidly. 
> 
> A mere 3 days ago, I was able to recruit four adventurers from [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md) as forward scouts. These were: [Indigo](../../directory/Deverain/Indigo.md), [Rushd](../../directory/Sigisfarne/RushdIbnUbada.md), [Daegal](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Daegal.md), and [Gary](../../directory/Deverain/Gary.md). 
> 
> When we got close to the Mouth of the Wall, the party was sent forth. They encountered a group of savage creatures. Human-like but malformed and with blue skin. Their eyes were as black as the night. More importantly, these savages were attacking a father and his daughter. If it weren't for the bravery of Indigo, as he told me, the two would have been carried off. They even got one of them alive, who is now secure inside a makeshift prison.
> 
> Later the group reported that a village close by has been thoroughly ransacked. A robed figure seems to be leading the savages and performing all kinds of unholy magic. Reverand Vandyke is most troubled by the reports. 
> 
> Now the last stretch was into the city, they checked the route and it was all clear. We expected opposition, but strangely, none was found. Although when Rushd joined the party, he was as pale as a ghost. The goldmaster is organising the lodging and markets for when we actually go into the wall. Next time, we will see what there is to find.
