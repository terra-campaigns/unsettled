## Dangerous trail

[Indigo](../../directory/Deverain/Indigo.md) and [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) meet [Irgith](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Irgith.md), a monk from the [monastery on the south](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/MiddleWatersMinster.md), and are guided by [Harald](../../directory/Kryptwood/Harald.md), a travelled barber-surgeon who came to [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md).
This group heads south in the [Duskmeadow Fringe](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/index.md) to reach [Deverain](../../directory/Deverain/index.md), the coastal town.
While crossing where [Hilda](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Hilda.md) was killed, Indigo takes some solemn time.
Harald's spirit feels her as well.

In the first hours of the journey, they see a [flock of crows](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/TheChoir.md) slowly following them with their heads as they walk past a tree.
The crows "speak" in a cacophony of cawing, and Harald understands they can answer questions for a price.
Irgith offers a twig that he has received from another crow in the past.

The flock is happy with it and answers questions:
There are human dangers on the coast;
There are bestial dangers in the mountains;
Silver protects against the risks in the mountains.

Later in the day, the group encountered bandits whom the [Hunger](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/TheHunger.md) attacked.

## Middle-Waters

The adventurers arrive at the monastery after supper.
Irgith knows the way and takes the group to a public dormitory.
[Stone](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Stone.md) arrives later in the night, delayed before departure from Sigisfarne.

In the morning, they have their breakfast beer, which is weaker than usual.
Irgith learns that the monastery has been suffering under heavy taxation from the [Mountain Court](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/MountainCourt.md).
The midday, afternoon, and dinner beers have all been affected and don't fill in as much as they should.

The group offers help to the Abbot.
Stone asks for help for his curse, to which the Abbot explains he cannot help.

## Bees grasslands 

The group travels south and finds it difficult to travel on an arid grassland due to the many bees.
They attempt to sleep in a cabin by the lake, but it proves impossible.

After slowly waking up, they continue their journey.
Indigo unlocks the door at the Crossing & Tax cabin by the river.
He steals coins from the desk while the others forge a tax collection theft by [Lord Griffin](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/LordGriffin.md).
They also destroyed some debt papers related to the monastery, Sigisfarne, and river runners in general.

## The palace in the mountains

At night, they finally arrive at the Mountain Court.
The village around the palace is not welcoming.
The group find a roof, for a night at most, in the [Church of the Weeping Mother](../../directory/weepingMother/index.md).
