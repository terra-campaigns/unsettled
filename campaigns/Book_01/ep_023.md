## The monk and the pastor

A group gets ready for another attempt at the [Tyrant's Tomb](../../directory/Kryptwood/TyrantsTomb.md).
A monk arrives at the hunting estate.
He seems to be lost, wanting to get to [Hendenburgh](../../directory/Kryptwood/Hendenburgh.md).
He introduces himself as [Lazlo](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lazlo.md).

[Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md), [Indigo](../../directory/Deverain/Indigo.md), [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Rook](../../directory/Kryptwood/Rook.md) and the new monk go to the village to prepare for the tomb.
Laszlo meets Gregory, and his sadness.
With kind and wise words, the monk convinces the giant blacksmith to accept his fate.
Wet with tears, Gregory takes the group to the church to introduce the pastor to the monk.
Gregory would leave Hendenburgh that night, sealing his fate.

[Pastor Noonan](../../directory/Kryptwood/PastorNoonan.md), an old friend of Lazlo from the [Middle Waters Minster](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/MiddleWatersMinster.md), is now a bitter priest who has turned to alcohol.
However, he tells the group he has studied methods of exorcism deeply, and he could bind the hounds to the tomb if taken to each of the complex's rooms.
The Pastor also confides he has taken up another belief, the pagan [Sisters](../../directory/weepingMother/theSisters.md).

## A debt must be paid

Upon returning to [Aelfwin Estate](../../directory/Kryptwood/AelfwinEstate.md),  the group finds the place sacked.
The whiskey bottles are gone.
The highwaymen wrote on the wall with charcoal that the group still owes them.

At night, during Razzy's watch, a group of sprites come.
They sing an old song of the Amazon.
The hero of the song is named "Razzy, the Bunny".

The tallest of the sprites tells Razzy she needs to get back to [Queensweald](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Queensweald.md) to repay her debt to the Queen.
[Hippareiones](../../directory/FoldedBelow/Hippareiones.md) are attacking the creatures of the forest.

## The ritual

The group travels to the tomb.
Room by room, the Pastor performs the ritual of the [Weeping Mother](../../directory/weepingMother/index.md)'s exorcism.
After the bonekeeper gives it a piece of meat, one of the hounds befriends Rook.

Through a secret tunnel, the group finds a skeleton, which moves to attack Lorenz after the blacksmith touches the blue steel sword it holds.
After a quick skirmish, the group dispatches the undead creature.
Rook and Lazlo take its bones out of the tomb to bury the poor creature, so its soul can finally rest.
