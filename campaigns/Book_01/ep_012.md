## Soaking day

A group from Sigisfarne set out to travel south.
[Drake](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Drake.md) wants to find wiser people and investigate more about the black sword they found in the [Underground Temple](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/UndergroundTemple.md) a [week and a half ago](../../campaigns/Book_01/ep_009.md).
[Arlo](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Arlo.md) accompanies him because a town might be the perfect place to rob the rich.
[Cai](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Cai.md) and [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) follow because it is Drake.

The first morning starts uneventful until a torrential rain commences.
The river they follow quickly floods, and they are forced to camp on much higher ground by the end of the day.
While camping, they notice that most of their food, including some torches, is soaked.

## A Goat in a ruin

As they continue following the river, they find a tall wooden bridge.
Beyond the bridge, they see a loose goat ruminating.
Like [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md)'s, some ruined structures stand tall on the view.

After a quick investigation, the group finds some signs of human activity.
A small village may be nearby.
Arlo ties the goat and steals it.

Their options ahead are:

- Cross the river - would require finding a bridge, as the river is too full after the rain
- Continue through a swamp south
- Climb crags southwest
- Circumvent the area through the west

The group goes west.

## Grasslands to the west

As expected, the forest turns into a hilly grassland a few miles west.
This is similar to the northwest of Sigisfarne.

The group finds a hilltop to view the terrain around them better.
They see a vast, hilly grassland to the west and the woods to the east.
Exactly like they would think the [Duskmeadow Fringe](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/index.md) looks like.

They roast the goat on the hilltop and return the rations to Sigisfarne.
