## Travel north

[Drake](../directory/Sigisfarne/Drake.md), [Razzie](../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Hilda](../directory/Sigisfarne/Hilda.md) and [Stone](../directory/Sigisfarne/Stone.md) of [Sigisfarne](../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md) left the village searching for the [Quarry](../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Quarry.md) in the north area of the [Duskmeadow Fringe](../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/index.md).

They heard whistling on the way caused by the shapes a stream had carved into the rock over the years it has been flowing.

They arrived at the so-called [Rabbit Inn](../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/RabbitInn.md) at dusk and boarded for the night.


## A longer route

They set off to the northeast again, hugging the forest border and passing by the swampland.

A growth of Aveva made their eyes itchy and diverted them northwest for some time before they could get back on track.

In the evening, pumas followed them from afar but kept their distance.

They camped in the open plains that night and were disturbed by a [tall skeletal figure](../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/TheHunger.md) approaching, which the pumas, still in the vicinity, did not take kindly to. Warned by the feline’s growling and hissing, they packed camp quickly and set off again, away from the strange creature and travelling at night.

## Arriving at the quarry

They reached a part of the forest where the trees were dead and found a [cabin filled](../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/HuntersCabin.md) with game meat drying on racks. They stocked up and caught up on sleep before leaving and finding the Quarry.

Entering the [quarry](../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Quarry.md), they discovered veins of red mineral running along the walls and followed them to find a sheer drop they almost missed. They followed the steps leading down the ravine to discover a tunnel, inside which they could hear hammering and chiselling.

They decided to turn back at that point and return at a later time, leaving the rope and grappling hook there.
