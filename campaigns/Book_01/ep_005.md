## Full moon rabbits

[Mateus](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Mateus.md), [Cai](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Cai.md), [Hilda](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Hilda.md), [Oswin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Oswin.md) and [Yewtree](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Yewtree.md) travel the [Duskmeadow Fringe](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/index.md) North towards the [Quarry](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Quarry.md).

Far in the west, they see a [Spire](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/SkySpire.md), almost fading into the horizon.
They arrive at the [Rabbit's Inn](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/RabbitInn.md).
Martha (the owner) explains the Quarry is haunted.
She feels sorry for Yewtree's life and asks if he wants to live with her and her husband, Earnest.

It is a beautiful, clear sky with a full moon.
They camp on the forest's border.

During his watch, Mateus is startled by four rabbits. Unexpectedly, they do not flee. Mateus captures three of them. As he kills them, one shows a human expression of sadness.

## Earth's rhythm

On the second day, they revisit the hunter's hut. Mateus fears the dried meat is of human origin. Yewtree is not so sure.

Later in the day, they entered the quarry. Navigating slopes is dangerous, but they carefully progress.

A cave-in has separated the group. While some work to remove the stones and reunite with the others, Mateus and Hilda discover parts of a stone statue of a child: a head and a hand.

Deeper in the tunnels, they hear tapping on the rocks. The quarry's heartbeat.

## Stealing from children 

They find dozens of stone children in the depths, similar to the statue pieces found earlier. The stone children work to find rubies. A few ruby stones lie on the floor.

Yewtree asks one of the children where to mine, and the child points to the exact location.

The children invite the group to explore the caves even deeper, but they return to Sigisfarne.
