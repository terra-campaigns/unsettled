## Goatherd

[Drake](unsettled/directory/Sigisfarne/Drake.md), [Razzy](unsettled/directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Cai](unsettled/directory/Sigisfarne/Cai.md) and [Mateus](unsettled/directory/Sigisfarne/Mateus.md) travel southwest, towards the woods by the fields.
They are again on the [fringe](unsettled/directory/DuskmeadowFringe/index.md).

They find Yik, a young goatherd, who lost 3 of his goats.
He asks for help to find them.
They don't help.

Further into the sparse woods, Mateus feels a fox is hurt.
He finds it trapped.
She helps them find the missing goats.

On the way back to Yik, bringing his goats, the group finds holy.
Yik retributes by walking them to the entrance of the Fairy Trail.

## Darker Woods

The Fairy Trail sings.
They only have to follow the music.

They find three wolves, who speak on Mateus's mind:
"Your companions are mere prey compared to you. Never let them forget that."

The path does not make sense, almost in circles.
Meanwhile, flowers grow on Cai's head.

Music gets to a crescendo.
They arrive at the [Queensweald](unsettled/directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Queensweald.md).
Suddenly, to Razzie, Drake is as beautiful as Fae: his features become her ideal of beauty.
Branches and leaves work as a gate to a fae banquet.

## Banquet

Fauns, faeries, pixies, elves and dryads.
Plenty of good food, on tables with 3 or 5 legs.
They offer and expect the people from the village to eat well.

Beautiful place, with a pleasant song.
Lords and ladies wearing silks and jewellery.
One lady offers Razzie a brown cravat.
A tall mother elf offers Cai her daughter.

For hours, the Fae listen to happy mundane stories told by the men from the village.
It is all very interesting and engaging for everyone. 

They leave. Cai doesn't take the young elf girl.
The Fae are appealed that humans will not share their happy lives with a young elf girl.

## Forest Queen's Palace

On the way to the Forest Queen's Palace, they meet the [Horned Knight](unsettled/directory/DuskmeadowFringe/HornedKnight.md).
The Knight expects a game of chase.
Drake counteroffers a chase duel between the two, and to everyone's surprise, wins.
The Horned Knight kneels, recognising he was bested by a man.

The Horned Knight takes them to the Queen's court.
They are well received and the Queen listens to their plea.


Cai has her [vendetta from the molemen](unsettled/campaigns/Book_01/ep_004.md) lifted in exchange for her voice for a while. Razzie has hers lifted in exchange for her service once.

The people from the village are taken back to the edge of the Queensweald by the Horned Knight.
They go back to Sigsfarne.
Changed.
