Double time to [Deverain](../../directory/Deverain/index.md), they see a lot of smoke, its white.    
Then decide to investigate if they can stay there for the night.   
First, they find a life like doll, made of wax and stuffing.  
Then a play pretend dead woman, weak and huffing.  
The house they saw is occupied, by a swarm of bees.  
So, they find elsewhere to sleep, everyone agrees.  
Now, here is when it gets complicated, just hear me out.  
Because the first watch of het night [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) cries not loud.  
There is a man, a shape, a silhouette, but without a face.  
As Razzy pretends to be a bush, just shaking in place.  
The man is now [Dick](../../directory/Wyrmbark/Dick.md), and just to be a dick, takes Dick.  
Razzy then pokes [Gary](../../directory/Deverain/Gary.md) awake and says she feels sick.  
Then Dick comes back and says he just had to pee.  
But Razzy insists that Gary needs peek the corner and see.  
When Gary does, the three of them are sound asleep.  
Which makes no sense, they are awake and now peep.  
Razzy and Gary whisper and realize what’s at stake.  
Razzy notices this and pokes the others awake.  
They decide to investigate themselves to see who is real.  
While Razzy, Dick and Gary don't know yet how to feel.  
Gary agrees with Gary to try his blade of memories on Gary.   
While Dick eyes the ring of Dick and Razzy are just wary.  
Razzy still has her tail, but Razzy doesn't, stay with me here.   
And Dick has a magic ring, not the woman’s, just to be clear.   
Gary gets no memories because they are his own of course.  
So, Gary tries the blade on Razzy to get another source.  
This doesn't work so the blade must be fake; thus, Gary is too.   
Unless Gary also took Gary's blade, then we have no clue.  
Then Dick takes Dicks ring and Dick drops down dead.  
Dick declares "See I am real; Dick is the fake instead".  
So, there you have it, it's easy as can be.  
This is how you get two Gary, one dick and two Razzy.
