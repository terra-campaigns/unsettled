## Prologue 

Ten days ago, [a group of adventurers](ep_039.md) arrived in [Fort Duhrin](../../directory/Kaldhur/FortDuhrin.md).
[Dr Gary](../../directory/Deverain/Gary.md) was too curious to stay put fixing damaged structures because of the rain, so he decided to follow the southern face of the immense wall, and found himself in [an unexpected adventure](ep_040.md).
[Ayrrin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Ayrrin.md) used the time to hide from the heavy labour and rest.
[Oswin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Oswin.md) left [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md), met [Artea](../../directory/Wyrmbark/Artea.md) at the [Hunter's Cabin](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/HuntersCabin.md), and, after the river waters receded, travelled north to the Fort.

However, you are not the only ones arriving in the Fort.
Outsiders, people more tanned, with accents of the lords in the south, but expressions of the artists from the coast, flood the streets.
They were brought to the region to an excavation camp further east, but, like you, they heard stories of treasures in [Kaldhur](../../directory/Kaldhur/index.md).
