[Indigo](../../directory/Deverain/Indigo.md) hears from Yewtree that the adventurers have arrived in [Hendenburgh](../../directory/Kryptwood/Hendenburgh.md) and decides to go and meet them.
With [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md), [Gunther](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Gunther.md) and [Harald](../../directory/Kryptwood/Harald.md), they walk to the village a few times, under heavy rain.

They set up an ambush that ended up with Elizabeth thrown in the river.
They then learn that she has been stealing organs to perform a ritual to become [a Crone](../../directory/Kryptwood/TheCrones.md) herself.
Harald surgically removes a penis from one of the deceased in the boat house, and they search for a heart to no avail.

The group then explains to Gregory what Elizabeth has been doing.
Gregory brings Oliver, the guard, who locks her up.

In the lodge of [Aelfwin's Estate](../../directory/Kryptwood/AelfwinEstate.md), they find 14 bottles of Dragonfire whiskey and are terrified when they think a bear is in the basement.
But it was a taxidermied bear.
They also find a letter, from a noble hunter, Mateo Jonas Niral, addressed to Lord Aelfwim, explaining he has finally found his great-great-great-grandfather's hunting manor inside the forest.
