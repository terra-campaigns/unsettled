Can you see it? Skulls are lookin’ back
We can free it if we blast this chap
I can hit ya through the darkness of the oil spill
When I lost it, yeah, bomb held in hand
And I tossed it, couldn’t let it stand
You were wailin’ *as we drove into the oil spill *

So, say oh hell no, say you got to go
Say oh hell no, say you got to go
Say flute and throw, say you are so slow
Say you got to go

Can you feel my wrath?
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away
Can you feel my wrath? (My wrath, my wrath, my wrath, my wrath)
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away
Say you got to go

Well, we rushed it, movin' way too slow
That we crushed it, but it's time to go
We can make this row through the thickness of the oil slick

So, say oh hell no, say it’s time to go
Say oh hell no, say it’s time to go
Say we go so slow, say we got to row
Say it’s time to go

Can you feel my fear? (My fear, my fear, my fear, my fear)
bones away, bones away
bones away
Can you feel my fear? (My fear, my fear, my fear, my fear)
bones away, bones away
bones away


Well, I'm just a boy with a broken toy
All lost and coy at the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here we strand on the mossy land
But we've found our boat in the middle of the stinky swamp
Now we’re climbing down through the ship we found
Bodies all around being very careful not to fall
And they rush to me and it time to flee
So lucky we have these as we crash trough the outer wall 

So, say oh hell no, say it’s time to go
Say oh hell no, say it’s time to go
Say blow through the bow, say straight through the bow
Say it’s time to go

Can you feel my fear?
(Say oh hell no, say it’s time to go)
(Say oh hell no, say it’s time to go)
Bombs away, bombs away
(Say oh hell no, say it’s time to go)
Bombs away
(Say oh hell no, say it’s time to go)

Can you feel my fear?
(Make this leap)
(Make this leap)
(Why this deep, ooh)
(Why this deep, ooh)
Can you feel my fear?
