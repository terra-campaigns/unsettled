People settle in villages and towns.  
They bring order to their lives and surroundings.  
Strict hierarchy and rules apply.  
This pleases the ***Law***.

Dark places spread and fold and coil unto themselves.  
Like an ever-growing virus.  
They make the impermanent.  
This pleases ***Chaos***.

***Law*** and ***Chaos*** hate each other destructively.  
They can only act on their hate through their acolytes.

You led an everyday life.  
Not anymore.  
You are now ***unsettled***.

# System

***Book I*** is a **Cairn 2e** campaign.  
**Cairn 2e**'s <a href="https://cairnrpg.com/second-edition/" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8mFMxYSdlwrsfwhT0CNalPoW9gdl5uE/view?usp=drivesdk" target="_blank">PDF</a> versions are available for free.  

## Character generation

You may use the character generator provided below.  
You may adapt your *Description* and *Bonds* sections as you see fit.  
Paste a copy of your character and introduce them on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1060840338777964565/1340382334674927647" target="_blank">Dramatis Personae</a> channel.

## Travel

A **Hex** takes a **Watch** to cross.  
A **Barrier** cannot be crossed normally, unless with specific knowledge of a pass.
Through a pass, crossing a **Barrier** takes a **Watch**.  
Travelling through well maintained roads, or downriver, doubles the speed.

**Barriers** and **Landmarks** are not normally presented on the map.
If someone attempts to travel out of a **Hex** through a **Barrier**, they are not able to, but still spend the time.
Exploring a **Hex** takes a **Watch** and presents all its **Landmarks** and **Barriers**, if any.

Roll dice when necessary.
Normally ***d6*** (bigger dice for safer regions).
**Weather** affects posterior die sizes.
If travelling at **Night**, or under looming weather, roll for **Getting Lost**.

|           |                            |                                                                                                                                    |                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
|           | **Each Watch**             | **Each day**                                                                                                                       | **Getting lost**                           |
| ***1***   | **Encounter.**             | **Dire weather.**<br>Fatigued unless you stay put.<br>You can't rest.<br>Someone's food or lights spoil.<br>You risk getting lost. | **Lost.**<br>Circle back to where started. |
| ***2-3*** | **Signs** of an encounter. | **Looming** threat.<br>You risk getting lost.                                                                                      | **Drift**.<br>Left(2) or Right (3).        |
| ***4+***  | All clear.                 | Fine weather.                                                                                                                      | Normal progress.                           |

If ***2-3*** is rolled twice, treat it as a ***1***.  

## Downtime

Between sessions, you may take ***one*** **Downtime Action**.
**Downtime Actions** can be used to develop **Domain Projects**.
Some actions and projects require costs to be paid and milestones to be reached, respectively.
Roll a ***d6*** (***d8*** if your background can help you).

|           |                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ***1***   | **Disaster.** You are unsuccessful. You trigger a complication or may lose ***d6*** of an attribute.         |
| ***2-3*** | **Setback.** You are partially successful and suffer a setback (e.g.: fatigue, reputation, loss, inflation). |
| ***4+***  | **Success**. You are successful. You get excellent results with ***6+***.                                    |

Research, treasure trade, training, carousing, care/recovery, forage/hunt, build, and strengthening community ties are examples of **Downtime Actions**.
Building farms, establishing institutions, developing businesses, running a established business, training retainers are examples of **Domain Projects**.
The lists are not comprehensive; you may propose other actions or projects.
