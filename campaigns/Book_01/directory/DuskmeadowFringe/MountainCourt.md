Ancient Crown post in the mountains.
Most of the court is afflicted, as if bitten by beasts, although it is disguised as a cultural aspect.
The Crown hides them, and the local population pretends it is false.
It depends on the Crown, which starts to despise them.

On the full moon, the beast-bitten go to a cavern in the mountain and lock themselves in.

# Court

Direct vassals of the Crown.
There are around 40 lords and ladies.
Well-dressed, live with all kinds of animals in the Palace.
All humans possess a great build and exhibit some animal-like aspects.

## Palace

Open and built in blocks.
Colourful columns and walls.
Smell of manure.

## Lord Griffin

Has a thick skin, like a hide.
Speaks slowly with a coarse voice.
Has established a tax post by the river.
The priest of the Church of the Weeping Mother is a kind supporter of him.

## Lord Derron

Scarred and deformed hands, and wears a bracelet full of small rubies.
Very friendly and adored by the court and villagers.
Seeks help because his daughter is sick.

## Lady Amelia

She has been in a bestial form for months, with insect wings and a bee's eyes.
She feels her father has put her here and does not care for her.
He has never come since she is in the cave.
She hears other lords and ladies come to take their bestial form under the full moon, but they all go back to the court after, and she does not.

# Vassal Village

Life under the Mountain Court's rule has always been harsh.
The 30 families receive most of the farm produce you need, and can work the land, but are required to pay a monthly tribute or offer sacrifices in the cave during the full moon.

Two brave villagers, Galen and Theron, left a month ago in a desperate act to pillage a bandit hideout across the river.
They never came back.
