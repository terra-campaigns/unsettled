**Traits**:
You have a Flabby Physique, Rosy Skin, and Long Hair. Your Face is Sharp, your Speech Droning. You have Filthy Clothing. You are Courageous and Rude.

**Description:**
An odd birthmark, a strange smell: somehow, the touch of elsewhere still lingers. Wherever you are, you have trouble fitting in. 

**Bonds**:
A white crow appeared to you in a dream, holding a twig in its mouth. You awoke the next morning with The Twig (petty) in your hand. You believe it brings you luck. It smells faintly of sulfur.

**Who took you in?**
The monks of a secluded forest monastery. When their rules became too strict, and you snuck away. Take a Monk's Habit (warm, petty) and a Spellbook of Control Plants.

**What keeps bad tidings at bay?**
Stink Jar: Shattering this jar releases an odor so foul all nearby must make a STR save or immediately vomit. 1 use. 

Blessed by all Crows.
