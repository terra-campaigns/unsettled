Dungeon Full Of Monsters 

Th e Ἱππαρείωνες once ruled over the entire Plain of Golden Grasses. In ages past
they would come sweeping down upon the civilized world in great marauding hordes,
but that was before they gave themselves to the gods of chaos on the eve of extinction.
One day in autumn, dragons descended upon them and sacked their temple,
which lay in the very middle of the Golden Grasses, at the foot of the Spire of Law.
With their spiritual centre destroyed, Hippareionian culture crumbled. Kamikaze-like
raids into neighbouring cultures became the norm. Death in battle was considered
the greatest achievement of all. But some small portion of the Hippareiones wanted,
more than anything else, to live on, and so they turned away from the traditions of
their forebears and took to worshipping the gods of chaos and darkness.
Th e Hippareiones now live as nomads and cave-dwellers in the shadows of
civilization, as merchants of exotic goods and hierophants of strange pantheons. Th ey
hate dwarves most of all, and vie with them for control of the mountains and vaulted
caverns where they can stay out of sight and undisturbed. Occasionally serving in
mercenary bands alongside humans or even as gladiators in the arenas of the minotaur
kings, their main objective, culturally, is to increase the power of their gods.
