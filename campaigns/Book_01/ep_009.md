## Vendetta

The group leaves Sigisfarne on a misty morning.
[Hilda](directory/Sigisfarne/Hilda.md), [Drake](directory/Sigisfarne/Drake.md), [Stone](directory/Sigisfarne/Stone.md), [Yarrow](directory/Sigisfarne/Yarrow.md) and [Razzy](directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) travel again to the [underground temple](directory/DuskmeadowFringe/UndergroundTemple.md) in the [Fringe](directory/DuskmeadowFringe/index.md).

Walking through the crops by the river, they see small tranches in the ground.
Three groups of three [Piot Chants](directory/DuskmeadowFringe/PiotChant.md) approach them.
The fae sings songs, which bring thousands of ants to the crops.
They explain they are here to "eat" Hilda.

Hilda runs into the river.
The fae chatted with the rest of the party.
Stone eventually learns their Vendetta song.

One of the groups of Piot Chants takes off their clothes and armour and gets into the water upriver of Hilda.
With their insect pincers, they swim towards her, and she is mortally wounded.
Somehow, the water around them freezes.
The icy blood is washed down the river.

## The flooded cave

After a few hours, the remaining adventurers find Hilda's body stuck on a branch in the flooded area of the river.
They recover her items and secure her body out of the water's way.

The group meets [Indigo](directory/Sigisfarne/Indigo.md), another dweller of Sigisfarne.
He also searches for the caves and wants to adventure with the others.

In the cave, they find pooled water again.
This time, a thicket has grown from the left wall.
It gives way to the adventures as they come close to it to avoid the deeper part of the pool.

## The temple

On the first level, most remain as they left it a few weeks ago.
The floor trap is closed again, and the statue of the fat person is in a different position.
Like before, the group carefully opens the trap and climbs down to the cathedral.


Checking the doors and tunnels, some walls were covered by glass mosaics, now broken.
Yarrow is reminded of the far lands on the east by the red tiles behind mosaics.
The group decides to try the left single door, behind which they hear some heavy breathing and thuds.
As they open the door, the noises stop.

The group realise they have interrupted three [insect-centaurs](directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Hippareiones.md) mating.
They speak a guttural idiom, but the smaller one can speak simple human language.
It explains it learned it from dying adventurers in the pit.
They refer to the [three-eyed](directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Reptiloids.md) as hostile creatures.

In the pit, the party finds the desiccated bodies of previous adventurers.
With them, a black sword, well maintained, with a skull on its pommel.
They also find a few coins and a serviceable gambeson and a note with the words: “Big Market”, “Wall, and “Village”.
Stone decides to leave with the findings, travelling back alone to Sigisfarne.
