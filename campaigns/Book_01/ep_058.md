## Razzy meets her vendetta

On a cold and sunny Feb-Sit morning, [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Oswin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Oswin.md), [Brunhilda](../../directory/KAW/Brunhilda.md), [Waximilian](../../directory/Deverain/Gary.md), [Pela Croftman](../../directory/Ambaret/PelaCroftman.md), and [Tia](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Tia.md) decide to return to the [Underground Temple](../../directory/FoldedBelow/UndergroundTemple.md).
Their travel is interrupted when they are ambushed by the [Piot Chant](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/PiotChant.md).
The small creatures say they are here to kill Razzy.
The others are free to go.

The group discusses with the faerie creatures, but no deal is reached.
The Piot Chant enchant the area to hold others, and avoid them, protecting the half-witch.
The group fight back, and Razzy calls for the second fae name she has: Valiana.
Turns out Valiana is the name of the [Horny Knight](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/HornedKnight.md).

The Knight runs from some trees towards Razzy, but he is not fast enough.
By the time he arrived, Razzy was slain.
He cries and takes the half-witch body for a ceremony at the [Queensweald](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Queensweald.md).

## Abandoned underground temple

After losing their friend, the group pushes on.
They navigate the cavern system and arrive at the temple.
The location is completely empty, not claimed as home by anyone else since their last visit.

Upon exploring the underwater cavern tunnel on the lower level, Waximilian finds a secondary path in and out of the temple: underwater from a river cave.
The group is exhausted and decides to continue the investigation on another day.

## Song

> Parody of "Rango theme song" by Los Lobos

From out the dusk came a gal true and bold  
Favorite of the forest queen  
By night she wore ghillie , by day kidnapped goblins  
And the townspeople knew her as   
Razzy   

Comin' down the countyside the people hailed her name  
And for her legend they worry  
With sticks in her hair and mud on her feet  
She cast befuddle and thicked   
-Razzy   

Razzy, Razzy  
Razzy, Razzy-y  
Razzy   

A half witch indeed, from her head down to her tail  
Razzy was busy exploring  
But in came molemen from their hideout in the hill  
With a notion to kill  
-Razzy   

Razzy, Razzy  
Razzy, Razzy-y  
Razzy   

Now Razzy, she is gone, but her legend still lives on  
In the Queensweald and forests of the fae wild  
She lived as she died - with a spellbook at her side  
And all the children cried out for Razzy   

Razzy, Razzy  
Razzy, Razzy-y  
Razzy
