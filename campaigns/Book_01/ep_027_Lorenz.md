The party went to seek insect-taurs.  
So they walked for about eight hours.  
To a place with ruined towers.  
Once there, they looked around,  
Until a certain church was found,  
that concealed a temple underground.  
Inside two creatures with four head?  
They choose not to loose the life the had,  
and pay the toll with coins instead.  
There was a door that blocked access.  
They opened the door but alas,  
The lock was filled with poison gas!  
They went into the room, past the door,  
saw a carved stone altar on the floor,  
and a very nice mace, no more.  
Down they went on the stairs,  
with a mace that was not theirs.  
To find those insect-taurs lairs.  
At the bottom was a weird thing to see,  
in a pudle of dried old poop and pee,  
two dead creatures, with legs times three!  
They see remnants of a fight,  
then hold open a door with all their might.  
and enter a cave with no light.  
A thousand footsteps they then hear.  
A robed man comes limping near,  
And in broken English, makes it clear.  
They must pay ten coins, I don't think they can.  
So the party shone a light and ran,  
Into chest high spider- centaurs, guarding the man.
