Those who travelled to Sigisfarne in the last few days met [Theron](../../directory/Wyrmbark/Theron.md) at the [Rabbits' Inn](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/RabbitInn.md).
The Druid Man in Arms picks up a brawl with three [Highwaymen](../../directory/Kryptwood/Highwaymen.md) from [Hendenburgh](../../directory/Kryptwood/Hendenburgh.md).
It is all resolved after a few rough minutes, nothing beyond a few bruises. 

## Early journey

To avoid [Jock](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Jock.md)'s men catching [Indigo](../../directory/Deverain/Indigo.md), the group leaves for the [Titan Spire](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/SkySpire.md) before dawn.
Four hours later, in the hills, [Ayrrin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Ayrrin.md) sees a group of [Spider People](../../directory/FoldedBelow/SpiderPeople.md) scouting north, following the river.
The party goes around, making sure they do not cross the mercenaries.

## A waking giant

Upon arriving at the Titan Spire, Ayrrin notices its hand has moved slightly.
The group enters its mouth, and the environment hints at the Titan waking up - it is warmer, and the heart sound is louder.
Realising it is a living creature, [Rook](../../directory/Kryptwood/Rook.md) wonders if it is natural that it is coming back from death.
But is it?

The same [cultist](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Filakh.md) from the previous day toils in the room.
When asked how they communicate with the Spider People, whose language is guttural and unknown, the man tries to run out of the statue.
Theron quickly jabs him in the head, putting him to sleep.
Part of the group goes to the helmet room, while the others go towards the long ladder.

In the helmet room, [Flax](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Flax.md) takes down an unconscious cultist and moves him aside before putting on the helmet.
The fieldwarden is paralysed, and after a moment starts to see from the Titan's eyes.
Eventually, Indigo removes him from the helmet, and Flax recovers consciousness after a few minutes.
Something in his mind has changed, though.

Those at the long ladder end up in a fight with the spider people.
One of the eight-legged brutes survives and flees towards the grasslands.
Before it can meet its companions, coming from the river, Theron's wolf, Brulf, kills it.

## A pounding heart

The remaining spider people come inside the statue, ignoring what awaits them.
In the kerfuffle, Theron steps on his own trap and falls unconscious when a stone hits his head.
The spiders are quickly hacked down, but two flee when Ayrrin attacks them with her Scaled Mace.

Realising the Titan's heart is pounding hard, the group descends to the heart chamber.
The *Blessed One* strikes the organ with a lightning bolt, waking the Titan.
As the statue tries to stand up, everyone inside collides with the ground and the walls.

The *Blessed One* runs for the helmet, but Indigo breaks the ceramic arteries feeding the heart before they arrive there.
The Titan falls and lies dormant again - now in a prone position.
The adventurers are quick to leave the vicinity of it before further harm is done.
The spire, outside, lies ruined in the grassland.
