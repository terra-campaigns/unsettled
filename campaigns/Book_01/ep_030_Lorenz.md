*"I, Lord Griffin, hereby decree,  
This town now belongs to me!  
For my first act as mayor, you see  
I will multiply your taxes by three.  
What’s that, Lazlo, you don’t agree?  
Then I send my companions after Thee!  
They will bring me your heads, with glee. "*   

*"Why did you return empty handed, you flea!"   
"Well, my lord."* while bending the knee.  
*"They ambushed us, from the shrubbery."   
"They had a fey elf with them, it was crazy, o gee!"   
"The thing was 4 meters tall, and very scary!"  
" Surrounded by darkness, we had to flee!"   
"She told us to leave the town and let it be"*.  

And so they went to the statue, the party.  
They collected some blood for a memory.  
Then found a robed man, who could it be?  
*"We're not interrupting something, are we?"  
"Uhm, well yes, you must go now, i plea".  
"But we are so intrigued, please, spill the tea".  
"I'll tell, but our god might find you" "will he?"*.
