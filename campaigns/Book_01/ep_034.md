[Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md), [Indigo](../../directory/Deverain/Indigo.md), [Nyx](../../directory/Perdut/Nyx.md), [Ayrrin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Ayrrin.md) and [Razvan](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) leave the [Hunters Cabin](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/HuntersCabin.md) trying to reach [Fort Duhrin](../../directory/Kaldhur/FortDuhrin.md).

## Lost in a thunderstorm

On the first day, a summer thunderstorm presents itself to the travellers.
In mere hours, they find themselves utterly lost.

By the end of the day, still under heavy rain, they decide to rest in an abandoned campsite.
At night, two man's voices try to convince the group to drop their weapons.
The group buys the bluff and walks away.
They are not followed.

On the second day, still under heavy rain, the group finds a waterfall.
Crossing, Indigo loses his balance and falls into the water pool.
He is saved and loses some petty items.
No gold is lost.

The third day is sunny.
Nyx climbs a tall tree and, looking at the mountains to the north, the group finds their way again.
They travel towards the [Big Ford](../../directory/Wyrmbark/ElderWay.md).

## Monastery of the Elder Way

The travellers are received by a hairy teenager called Poppy.
Poppy explains that some druids seek the Old One to leave for [Kaldhur](../../directory/Kaldhur/index.md).
The group is introduced to an elder druid, Pepper.

## The woman from River Nevask

After spending the night in the big ford, they build a raft with the druids and paddle north, through the River Nevask.
In the afternoon, they see an immense tree, burning inside.

Hours later, they see many small familial villages by the river's margins.
The villagers are wary of the travellers and pick up makeshift weapons in case the group disembarks.

A child tries to dominate two anxious goats.
The animals misbehave until a [woman](../../directory/Kaldhur/WitchNevask.md) in brown robes comes and calms them down.
The woman looks at the group with *unsettling* eyes.

That night Lorenz dreams of the woman.

## Arriving at the fort

The fort is built at the edge of the giant wall.
The wall could host cities within, given its size and girth.

The fort is mostly empty, with many [Gauntlet](../../directory/Kaldhur/Gauntlet.md) guild members adventuring inside the forest proper.
