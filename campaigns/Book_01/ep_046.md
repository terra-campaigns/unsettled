On a dark swampy river
Fast wind in my hair 
Warm smell of old corpses
Rising up though the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a curious sight
The storm grew heavy and the light grew dim
I had to stop for the night 

There he stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
I was thinkin' to myself 
" this could be heaven or this could be hell" 
He didn't light up a candle
But he showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say 

"Welcome to the muchroom monaste-ry
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of shroom at the muchroom monaste-ry
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here" 

His mind mycelium-twisted 
He got a mushroom on his head, uh
He got a lot of pretty, pretty shrooms
That he calls friends
How they stand in the courtyard
Sweet spores they spread
None of them can remember
Even time they forget

So i called up the head monk
"Please show me your shrine"
He said " we haven't had that spirit here, since a full moon or 9"
And still those voices are chanting from far away
Wake me up in the middle of the night 
Just to hear them say 

"Welcome to the muchroom monaste-ry
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of shroom at the muchroom monaste-ry
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here" 

Fungal on the ceiling
Glowing very nice, and he said
"We have all become one in here
Of our own device"
And in the improvised diner
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
And they just eat all the yeast

Last thing I remember, he put
Shroom juice on my head
I had to find out if I was
Infected with the fungal net
"Relax" said the head monk
"We are programmed to receive
You can walk out any time you like
But you can never leave"
