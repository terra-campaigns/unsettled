## Bittersweet berries  
  
On a sunny day, [Drake](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Drake.md), [Yewtree](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Yewtree.md), [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Mateus](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Mateus.md) and [Cai](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Cai.md) travel south, following the river down the slopes.

On an overflown area, a large bush shining with berries.
The group is inebriated with their juices and forages beyond what they can consume, which they will eventually return to [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md).

They lose track of time, and the weather changes to freezing rain, hindering their journey through the [fringe](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/index.md).
  
## The cave  
  
They enter the cave and navigate it as described by the teenagers, Clive's friends.  

They find a group of three red-eyed [reptiloids](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Reptiloids.md) in a large pool of water, which seem to speak their guttural language.
There is no hostility, only wariness.  

Petrified trees have been partially dug out.
Once made of iron-bound wood, the temple's doors are also petrified.
Their carvings reminding of the church's [weeping mother](../../directory/weepingMother/index.md).

Beyond, continuing on the cave, they find a mass of animal and human limbs in different states of decomposition.  
  
## The underground temple  
  
The doors are heavy, but the group can enter the [underground temple](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/UndergroundTemple.md)
Inside are larger-than-life statues of people in noble but strange clothes.
Their faces have been scrapped.
The doric columns smell like dust, and the ceiling is very high and fan-vaulted.

Down the stairs, there is a large floor trap.
Above, a massive statue of a very fat person, repugnant and weird.

The floor opens to some underground cathedral.
Its floor is littered with broken pieces of stone.
They find a strange music box and tall mushrooms grow from the walls.  

Other exits are found, but the group is tired and finds it safer to return to Sigisfarne.
