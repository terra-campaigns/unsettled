# Mortunt celebration

> A night where revellers gather around massive bonfires, drinking and making merry before going off in groups of two or three to “kill Death” (or, really, do whatever small groups of young people might do during a night of debauchery). 

A group of people sit by the fire and celebrate their year with song.
