A group leaves [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md) for another incursion into the [Underground Temple](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/UndergroundTemple.md).
[Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md) carries his blue-steel sword, which he noticed can indicate the direction of flowing waters like a compass.
[Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md) continues, determined to pay her dues to the lovely forest people.
[Ayrrin](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Ayrrin.md) in morbid curiosity; it's both natural and unnatural, in a way.
[Soren](../../directory/Kryptwood/Soren.md) with his rodents, still thinking about how to solve the [molemen](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/PiotChant.md) problem with no violence.

After a week of foggy and cold mornings, they see the [Northern Spire](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/SkySpire.md) lit at the darkest hours.
Curious, they still go with the plan the next morning, and travel south.

## Meeting Repitiloids

After entering the now-well-known dark paths in the cave system, the adventurers reach the temple's tripartite door.
They hear a low, wet rasp of clicks and hisses, like glass scraping over a whisper.
Ayrrin opens one of the doors, holding the scaled mace in her hand and sees a [Reptiloid](../../directory/FoldedBelow/Reptiloids.md).
While she is filled with sudden courage, the creature is also filled with disgust for her and jumps at her.

The rest of the group swarms it.
In the chaos of melee, the Repitiloid pierces Ayrrin's chest, and she falls unconscious.
As Lorenz hits it, it sees visions of the creature's memory:

Lorenz sees a reptiloid's memories while he hits it.
The creature stuffs an old man in a green cloak inside an amulet.
Later, this same Repitiloid walks, dazed, through yellow smoke to a cavern balcony, overlooking deadlands.

The group finally kills it and rests afterwards.
Razzy wakes Ayrrin up, and they continue into the temple.
On the copy church below, they see another reptiloid, which keeps its distance and lets the party pass through.

## Handzies' Business

Going through the Iron Door, where the rock faces in the cave change, they paid the coins to the robbed man and the [Anttaurs](../../directory/FoldedBelow/SpiderPeople.md).
Through a green velvet curtain, they meet two [giggly alien creatures](../../directory/FoldedBelow/GreenWitches.md).
They have mouths in their hands and mimic everyone's speech and movements.
The Handzies (as the group names them) explain that [this place](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/YellowSmoke.md) offers many pleasures, most embedded in yellow smoke.

## Yellow Smoke Patrons 

They access a large room filled with yellow smoke through another velvet curtain.
Many patrons can be seen here, although the smoke makes it difficult to see details.
The heavy-robbed man from weeks ago, [furrykins](../../directory/FoldedBelow/Bugbears.md), [two-headed-over-a-head-men](../../directory/FoldedBelow/Murk.md), [reptiloids](../../directory/FoldedBelow/Reptiloids.md) and a knight of the realm.

The knight, very drugged, introduces herself as Knight-Tenant Harbeger.
She comes from Ambaret, the realm's capital, where she rules a small holding.
She explains that she made a fortune as a treasure hunter before being knighted and that the best treasures lie in the [forest beyond the wall](../../directory/Kaldhur/index.md).
She also warns them to stop treasure hunting before greed becomes madness.
Razzie is astonished when the knight says that any forest queen south of the wall is not a real queen.

Finally, the group finds the [Hippareiones](../../directory/FoldedBelow/Hippareiones.md).
They were again mating - three of them.
In a corner, two goblins lie tied in.

Ayrrin decides to draw the insect-centaurs to distract them.
The creatures are keen to be drawn while mating in weird positions.
Soren darts them to sleep.
The others move the goblins, and the group returns to the surface after finishing the drawing.

"Don't take the workers..." one of the Handzies says when the group runs through their cave room.

The [Horned Knight](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/HornedKnight.md) is unhappy with how it went.
But he does not turn angry.
He hits his hooves and tells Razzy she will hear from them if the problems persist.
Then, in what looks like a run, but sounds like a half-gallop, he goes away carrying his goblins (without untying them, as one would carry dead chickens).
