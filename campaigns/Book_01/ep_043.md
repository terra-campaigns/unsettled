We wake up on the cold hard ground.  
Our belongings nowhere to be found.  
Something strange is in the air.  
And there it is, black, spiky: THE CHAIR.   
It gurgles, oozes, writhes in glee.  
Then murmels louder *sit on me*   
We strike the foul thing, axe in hands!  
It does nothing, The Chair just stands.  
The doors, windows, stairs we try it all.  
Then end up in the dining hall.   
A table filled, one end an old man  there  
But on the other end, that wicked Chair!  
The man screams, we fought, we tried  
But in the end we all just died.   

We wake up on the cold hard floor.  
All of us different than before.  
The man still there, sipping his tea.  
Sneaking past him, a kitchen we see.  
Another dead end, try the washroom.  
"Just a minute" sounds in the gloom.  
A woman, an empty bath, a bucket.   
The Chair! We take the water, chuck it.  
The woman melts, an axe of bone.  
We take it and destroy the fleshy throne.
