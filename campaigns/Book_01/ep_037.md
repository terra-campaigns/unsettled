## Prologue

[Cobb](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Cobb.md) walks to a small wooden box, steps on it and shouts to the party:

> *Hear ye! Hear ye!*
> 
> *Brave souls of this [realm](../../gazetteer/Gravenmark.md), lend me your ears!*
> 
> *Darkness festers beneath our very feet. The vile [moles](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/PiotChant.md) have clawed their wretched tunnels into our western lands. They have slain our brothers and sisters, defiled our fields, and corrupted our children. Their foul rites and heathen gods mock all that is good and sacred!*
> 
> *I will not lie to you... The path ahead is perilous. The shadows you face will seek to break your spirit and your steel alike. But I say this to you: what greater glory is there than to rise against the creeping dark? To stand where others have fallen?*
> 
> *This is our moment! Our holy calling! Together, we shall drive these vermin back into the depths and cleanse the land with righteous fire!*
> 
> *Raise your hearts, raise your steel! The West calls for deliverance!*
> 
> *WHO STANDS WITH ME? WHO WILL FIGHT?*

## Departure

Cobb again:

> *The new Day is upon us. A glorious moment for battle and triumph!*
> *The annals will tell about the battle at Molehill for aeons to come.*

Surprisingly, the party following the General are [Razzy](../../directory/Sigisfarne/Razvan.md), [Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md), [The Baron](../../directory/Deverain/BaronVonBetrüger.md) and [Jebbo](../../directory/FeverSwamp/Jebbo.md) - none experienced combatants.

## Slaughter

The group sets fire to two nest exits and threatens the molemen from the main entrance.
A fight ensues, with the molemen trying to bring the party inside the tunnels, but constantly being outmanoeuvred.
The knee height fae-moles call a vendetta on the party and [Sigisfarne](../../directory/Sigisfarne/index.md), but are quickly slaughtered - including their shaman.
The black smoke that took the nest killed even the child molemen.

## Epilogue

This and the "molehill massacre" do not go unnoticed by the bards of the region, so you might sometimes hear songs like this going around:

> *A merry band of mercenaries travels trough the woods.  
> And tow behind a brand new cart, full of stolen goods.*   
> *They call themselves the thornless,*  
> *Never failing to impress.*  
> *But when they go, down below, they often make a mess.  
> *They never leave a stone unturned ,search in every hole.*  
> *'Cause you never know if someone might just be a mole.*  
> *Killing moles left and right might be a big blunder.*  
> *Where they fight their very best is six feet under.*  
> *But beware when facing molemen kind*  
> *All your plans to take them down are always undermined*  
> *These heroes now go far and wide to face this fearsome foe...*  
> *That's usally about knee high or just a bit below.*
