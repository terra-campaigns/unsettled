Traverse the Fever swamp in winter, no less?  
Of course, to rescue a damsel in distress.  
Gary, the Baron, Aspen, Toram and Slate.  
But not Soren, he was late.  
Into the swamp to go South and go far.  
But are stopped by black floating tar.  
They study the mass and want to learn:  
If we light it on fire, will it burn?  
The mass rises, skulls follow and track,  
our movements, as we throw the dirt back.  
We go around and then come across,  
an island covered completely in moss.  
Slate and Toram look from higher ground,  
while Gary scraped some moss around.  
Aspen picks and eats a mushroom in bliss,  
the Baron stands on the rock to take a piss.  
Aspen looks a bit green and has a hurt tummy.  
Then oozes slime, but the shrooms are yummy.  
We try to not make her stick from toe to head.  
Now she looks a bit like the island instead.  
As we leave, Gary has a brilliant idea:  
What if we poke the island and flee!  
So he takes the oar and gets on the rim.  
While Slate just stares daggers at him.  
Gary pokes the thing, this was not very wise.  
A mossy giant appears! and begins to rise.  
We try the fleeing part, but its far to late.  
The thing reached out, we sure were afraid.  
It moves to the boat, straight for Aspen and then.  
takes off the moss and eats it. she calls it Sven.  
Sven pets Aspen, who responds with "Miauw"    
It does it back, we start asking questions now.   
Sven then plays his tombstone like a guitarist.   
"The Which is tortured and wants to die" is the gist   
So, we came to save the damsel in distress,    
but now, we just have to kill her, I guess.
