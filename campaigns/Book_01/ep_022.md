## Blizzard 

The day starts with a Blizzard.
There are no better options than staying put, in the lodge, drinking with your friends.

[Harald](../../directory/Kryptwood/Harald.md) remembers his teenage summers at this lodge, cleaning game with his uncle.
[Indigo](../../directory/Deverain/Indigo.md) only thinks about the Black Sword being brought with him, a "loan" from Drake.
[Lorenz](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Lorenz.md) and [Varg](../../directory/DuskmeadowFringe/Varg.md) cannot avoid thinking about their courses and how their lives would have been simpler without them.

A man dressed in black walks through the field.
He asks to stay in the lodge and introduces himself.
[Rook](../../directory/Kryptwood/Rook.md).
He is a bonekeeper who has been too close to death.

## The Highwaymen 

The sun shines the following day.
Their minds are foggy, with all the drinking the day before.
The group decides to walk to the [Highwaymen](../../directory/Kryptwood/Highwaymen.md)'s tower and bring some of the whiskey to sweeten a deal.

The group proposes that Sly George respect his agreement with the [Crones](../../directory/Kryptwood/TheCrones.md).
They are received in what looks like a trap to steal their goods.
After a round of drinks, the Highwaymen try to take one of them as a hostage.
The group can flee and, from a distance, agree to go to the [Tyrant's Tomb](../../directory/Kryptwood/TyrantsTomb.md) and bring something of value to the Highwaymen, and not be attacked by the bandits.

## The Tyrant's Tomb

They walk north to the tomb.
Rook recognises having passed here once, and the power of this locale.
The entrance stone door is shattered.

In the first room, they encounter a dead highwaymen, probably the one who opened the tomb.
A few minutes later, the group finds a secret passageway north, but hears growling from the eastern corridor.
Some shadowy and giant hounds stride toward the group.
Only Rook is cornered, but for some reason, the beasts do not attack him.
He is one of them.

The ones who fled see the highwaymen engage with the hounds.
One beast dies, and the other is dispatched hurt back into the tomb.
One of the men fell.
The others are hurt.

The group tries another expedition to the tomb and finds a secret passage behind an iron maiden, in a room northwest of the entrance.
The adventurers feel tired, so do the highwaymen waiting for them outside.
In peace, they agree that they will find something shiny and bring it back to the tower.
Otherwise, the highwaymen will find them in [Aelfwin's Estate](../../directory/Kryptwood/AelfwinEstate.md).
