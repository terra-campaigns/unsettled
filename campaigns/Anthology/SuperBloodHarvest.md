"
*The bloodship comes once per generation,*
*to swell its GUTS on our vitae.*
*...*
*You’ve been abducted by*
*a vampire space fortress.*
*You wake in a shallow sea*
*of blood, a fuel reservoir for*
*your immortal captors.*

I am Zedock Barnaby Lovegrove.
The ninth of the Cathedral of Luminous Neon.
I preach to humans and machines alike.

I woke up in a shallow pool of blood.
We are not alone here.
*You've drunk some of it.*
We sit atop what appears to be a floating platform.

A shimmering light beyond us.
I cannot devise any walls.
But some glass separates us from a green haze.
Beyond the haze, there are stars.

The others live in egg-like pods.
But we are not.
I see a hole in the middle, with some mechanism.
A ring around the hole makes a hissing sound.
It is like a machine sucks the blood from the pool we are in.
Now I realise we are connected to tubes, and these are connected to other pods.
*There is a 97% chance you left that pod to your right.*

One person walks to a trash pile I haven't noticed yet.
From a distance, it appears to be a pile of clothes or personal belongings.
I see I am naked.
I come from where my AI assistant's voice speaks.
I find my clothes and see that others found theirs in a similar container.
We all dress up.

One of the others pushes the glass-like wall.
The hole's mechanism pressurises air, which serves as an unclogging function.
*There is a 53% chance this transports the pods with differential pressure.*

The one at the rubbish pile annoys something in it.
Something jumps at her, but wow - someone else shoots darts at it immediately.
I now see that the thing looks like a snake made of metal.
The woman hits it in the head - a human head - with an iron cane, and it becomes immobile.
And it is deflating after all this.

Astonishingly, she finds a Cosmsuit.
*This is a Cosmsuit series 7a-H3 model 2 from the Hegemony.*
I dress it up.
I learn the woman is Wind on Chimes.
Her head is shaven and she wears grey robes.

It comes back to me.
I was abducted during the eclipse.
I was taken to the skies before I passed out.

I look at the pods.
They opened normally for us.

We push the snake corpse down the hole.
It is sucked the snake.
Then we push the cosmonaut down, which also gets sucks.

I jump first, and then come the others.
It ends in a bubble room.
We hear rhythmic humming in a second tunnel to the left.
Blood drains into this room from a third tunnel, straight ahead.
As the others come, I am shoved into the straight tunnel.

This slide takes me up now.
I end up in a room similar to the first one, with the blood pool, glass and green haze.
There are other pods again, with some dark red liquid inside and bodies floating.
Five vaguely humanoid, pale, and bony creatures order other humans into Cosmsuits like the one I am wearing now.
These creatures have elongated skulls, holes for ears, and four oversized fangs.
They are twice the height of a normal person, and wear robes and iridescent shimmering cloaks.

They lean in and make noises to me in their tongues.
They are forcing me to join the other prisoners.
And my friends come from the slide.
They don't know what to do with us.

These other prisoners smell something spicy and sweet.
Wind creates some confusion with the alien in front of her.
She picks a fight with it!
The monster hunter cowers, and I take his darts and throw two of them, hitting the alien in the mouth.

The shadow beaster cast his shadow as a shadow rat.
The rat jumps at the same alien we attacked before.

And then, out of nowhere, Wind slaps the alien's forehead.
And it turns off like a tablet with no battery.
The other prisoners cheer.
